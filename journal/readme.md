# journal

scans of my hand-written journal, diary, notes

this is just a small part of my journal

i write about 2 pages per day on average, over the last 10 years ...

most is trivial nonsense, but from time to time, i find new ideas, which are too good to forget

ideally i want to collect all of these "new ideas" in my book: [alchi/src/whoaremyfriends](../src/whoaremyfriends)
