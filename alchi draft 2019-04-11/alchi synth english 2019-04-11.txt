jungian extraversion:
E = extravert pathos.
I = introvert pathos.

jungian functions:
N = iNtuition = fire.
S = Sensing = earth.
T = Thinking = air.
F = Feeling = water.

new results:

male gender = romantic center = masculine culture.
female gender = classic center = feminine culture.
... cos both 'male gender' and 'romantic center' are on top.
in theory,
you can also corelate 'female gender' with 'romantic center',
but 'popular definitions' of masculinity
are more similar with 'romantic center'.

new speculation:

this might also be the meaning of the 'age' dimension,
with 'young age' = 'romantic center'
and 'old age' = 'classic center'.

todo: find more translations to the MBTI system.

difference to old 'circle of eight':
now, strong bonds connect air and water.
before, strong bonds did connect (air and air) and (water and water).



Web Of Types vs Circle Of Eight.

how do romantics pair? what are their 'strong bond'?
Web Of Types: M4--F3 and F4--M3
Circle Of Eight: M4--F4 and F3--M3

one argument for the 'Web Of Types' model:
i define pathos as 'other class' type,
so air can never play water,
and water can never play air.
this is why we need proximity of air and water.

one argument for the 'Web Of Types' model:
personal experience.
as M1, i feel closer to M4 than to F3.

one argument for the 'Circle Of Eight' model:
air and water have different diet needs.
air needs 'low carb' and water needs 'high carb' diets.
so, at least for nutrition, air and water should be separated,
and combined with the 'same element'.

another difference:
[really just a consequence of the 'strong bond' diff.]
pathos has different 'meanings' in the two models.
meaning as in: who do you need, when you play that role?
WOT: 124 143   213 234   342 321   431 412
COE: 124 133   213 244   312 331   421 442

both WOT and COE are a 'closed system' or a 'finite group',
so that every pathos (need and play) is found inside the system.
the WOT has 'discrete translation symmetry' [2d grid, lattice group, regular tiling, periodic function],
the COE has 'rotation symmetry' [cyclic group Z8].


names, roles:

air:   improvize     activity
fire:  perfectionize activity
earth: perfectionize passivity
water: improvize     passivity

air + fire = sanguinic mood = actors.
water + earth = melancholic mood = pastors.



how can we break the perfect defense?
with radical simplicity.

a system of common grounds.

if you lack friends, you compensate with principles and paradigms.
if you are trapped in "slave moral" then you are "lost in mating calls" and you are afraid of really finding answers.



physis vs pathos

what is real to one, is (only) image to an other.

real vs image.
serious vs joke.
physis vs pathos.
being vs acting.
strong vs weak.
sane vs pathetic.
rational vs irrational.
close vs distant.



well now.

in terms of CG Jung, i am NI = iNtuition + Introversion.
in terms of alchemy, i am 'fire plays water'.
in terms of psychiatry, i am hebephren-schizophrenic.
or: dreaming for a better reality.
or: god complex, natural authority. [god in private, see Hard Moral.]
or: crazy genius, arrogant dreamer.

claim:
my model is perfect,
that is,
it is so powerful,
it can explain ALL other models.
= i can provide simple translations
to other models.

Four Dimensions.
my base are four binary dimensions:
mood = sanguinic or melancholic
tempo = choleric or phelgmatic
gender = male or female
age = young or old, aka status [#todo is "status" a good synonym?].

class = outer tempo = romantic or classic.
corelations, similars:
psychotics = male, neurotics = female.
sanguinics = young, melancholics = old.

[see end of file for
translations to other models.]

assumption 1: find your self.
tendencies are inborn,
dictated by Body Type.
they fall into four elements:
3. Air = Endomorph.
1. Fire = Mesomorph Heart Shape.
2. Earth = Mesomorph Pear Shape.
4. Water = Ectomorph.
also gender is inborn, obviously.
when born, age == young.
.. so i get Eight Types
in one 'generation' = same age.
8 types = 4 elements x 2 genders.
[side note, the swastika has 8 lines.]

assumption 2: find your peers.
i dream:
every type needs two peers,
or two partners, or two 'next ones'.
ideally from an early age, from day one
= in early childhood.
the 'bonding rules' i found:
strong bonds:
M3 + F3, M1 + F2, M4 + F4, M2 + F1.
weak bonds:
F3 + M1, F2 + M4, F4 + M2, F1 + M3.
3 = Air, 1 = Fire, 2 = Earth, 4 = Water.
M = male, F = female.
all eight types form the Cirlce Of Eight:
    M3--F3
F1          M1
|            |
M2          F2
    F4--M4
line = strong bond.
proximity = weak bond.
upper half = sanguinics = air + fire. [#todo move to lower half = young age = small kids]
lower half = melancholics = water + earth.
left half = matriarchy = female fire = gender opposing body types.
right half = patriarchy = male fire = gender congruent body types.

#todo translation to distant types,
chain of commands,
feedback loop.

Cirlce Of Eight with Romantic Center.

F1        M1

|  F4--M4  |
| /      \ |

Majority vs Minorities.

Romantic Center = Romantic Majority + Classic Minorities.
Classic Center = Classic Majority + Romantic Minorities.



Who can read Body Type?
Who will lead my Initiation?
Element Fire.
to do so,
one must observe body shape
and body language.
observe with patience.
collect many impressions.
#todo tolerate deviations, exceptions.
logic expression rather shows Secondary Type.
body shape?
'only trust the naked ones.'
[if you do not believe in Physiognomics, skip this part.]
3. Air = endomorph = apple shape, overall chubby and round.
1. Fire = mesomorph + heart shape = strong shoulders.
2. Earth = mesomorph + pear shape = strong hips.
4. Water = ectomorph = banana shape, overall slim and long.
look at the hands.
compare middle finger and palm length.
long fingers = Romantic = Air or Water.
long palm = Phlegmatic = Fire or Water.
compare wrist joint
and the ring of thumb and mid-finger.
wrist bigger = Air = endomorph,
wrist same = Classic = mesomorph,
wrist smaller = Water = ectomorph.
look at the fingers.
strong joints = Air,
straight fingers = Classic,
pointing fingers = Water.
look at the nose.
short + pointed [concave] = Air,
medium pointed = Fire,
medium convex = Earth, [most 'straight' nose]
long + convex = Water.
also, Romantics tend to have a 'double nose tip'.
look at the skin pigment.
Earth has the most pale skin, and most dark genitals + asshole = dark bottom.
look at the nipples.
light and large areolas = air.
dark and small areolas = water.
look at the asshole = anus.
[they also do this in jail, to guess your type.]
light and small hole = sanguinics = air or fire.
dark and large hole = melancholics = water or earth
= chocolate starfish = good for 'passive anal sex'.
also compare mouth to anus.
full lips + small hole = sanguinic mood.
weak lips + strong hole = melancholic mood.
look at the genitals.
small and light = air.
large and dark = water.
[yea, i must be joking..
physiognomics is so unpopular.]
look at the head shape.
round = air, long = water.
look at the nose.
small pointed nose = sanguinics,
large convex nose = melancholics.
look at the chin + lower lip.
small chin = fire,
bigg chin = earth.
look at the ears.
large ears = romantics,
small ears = classics.
[problems come from 'race mixing' and 'small families'
to obfuscate these body signs.
'its all relative'
as in 'relative to the mainstream',
or 'relative to the average'.
if there is no mainstream,
it is more hard to compare.]
look at strength + fat distribution.
earth = strong bottom,
fire = strong front,
air = strong top [head],
water = strong back [cross].
mouth vs genitals.
romantics: strong mouth + weak genitals.
[oral fixated + sexually rather frustrated or frigid.]
classics: weak mouth + strong genitals.
[more physical than mental. strong but dumb.]

Symbols. Signs.
.. for the four elements.
3. Air = circle = three-cloud = three-shamrock.
1. Fire = heart = down = fall = V.
2. Earth = pear = spades = peak = up = rise = Lambda.
4. Water = four-star = cross.
7. Romantics = G [letter 7] = hexagram = rhombus = 'Merkel Raute'
= Square and Compasses = between rise and fall = bisexual.
Square and Compasses also shows the letter G.
12. Classics = celtic cross = between top and bottom = bipolar,
12 = L [as in Loser?], 21 = U, 1221 = ABBA

Three Letters. Three Syllables. ABC parties.

de-mo-crats,

CFR,
bil-der-berg,
py-ra-mid,
tri-an-gle,
.... you get the point.
for one, they love to show in numbers. [Numerology]
but then, three syllables have one center syllable,
which is the most important one.
the last syllable is of second importance,
the first syllable is of least importance.
first = signal to start a word.
this can be an 'article' like: le, de, la, etc.
second = center = main syllable.
this will carry the main VOWEL [primitive = infant language].
the second vowel should be emphasized = prolonged, as in
el-saa-tan, ca-ruu-so, da-boo-lus, la-tii-na, etc.
the third syllable is a modifier,
to change the sound of the second vowel.
#todo how exactly? emphasis, deviation, opposition .. 5 vowels = 5 elements



Sine Wave. Year Cycle. Day Cycle.

3. Air = summer = top = june 23 = hour 0.
1. Fire = fall = september 23 = hour 3.
4. Water = winter = bottom = december 23 = hour 6.
2. Earth = spring = rise = march 23 = hour 9.
Romantics = bisexual = between opposite gradients = extreme points.
Classics = bipolar = between opposite curvatures = inflection points.



Eigen Colors.

3. Air = Red.
1. Fire = Yellow.
2. Earth = Green.
4. Water = Blue.



#todo ?
Flag Colors.

bi color, from top to bottom.
3. Air = White White. 
1. Fire = Black White.
2. Earth = White Black.
4. Water = Black Black. 

classics wear contrast.
black covers the strong body half,
white covers the weak body half.
#center color [accent] shows the 'strong bond' peer.
romantics wear confirmation.
strong body of air is covered in white.
weak body of water is covered in black.



Positive Racism. Black Pride.

leftists love skinny black men so much,
cos they so much look like element water.
.. like a old school shaman,
who can solve ALL the problems.
[actually its 'only' communists
trying to exterminate all classics,
or at least all born fire.]



Names. Personalities [not disorders]. Signs.

3. Air = true Hysteric = optimist = winner = prince = top = high.
1. Fire = true Manic = dominant = posessive = ruler = king = fall = down.
2. Earth = true Borderline = subordinate = slave = rise = up.
4. Water = true Schizo = pessimist = loser = bottom = low.



Secondary Type.

what is psychopathy? [pathos]
the Escape From Loneliness.
provocation. mating call. defense mechanism.
dyscrasia. imbalance. deficiency.

in my model,
false education leads to sick minds.
remember assumption 2: find your peers.
[which would be Better Education,
congruent with natural order = inborn traits.]

every one of the eight body types
is trying to find its two peers.

to find one peer,
i go 'one step further' in the Circle Of Eight.
and play the 'next plus one' type.

example: i am M1 = male fire.
to find my first partner [strong bond],
which is F2 = female earth,
i change to M4 = male water.
in short: fire plays water, to find earth.

if this 'search for peers' is frustrated,
one gets stuck in the 'next plus one' state,
and most time is playing this Secondary Type,
or 'psycho type' in contrast to 'body type'.

fake, made, secondary = conceited not confident, weak not strong.

most psycho tests will only test your 'psycho type',
ignorant [blind] for your 'body type'.



Personality Disorders.

Classic plays Air = fake Hysteric.
Classic plays Water = fake Schizoid.
Romantic plays Fire = fake Manic.
Romantic plays Earth = fake Borderline.

in the Secondary Type, 
you can see the contrast between
born and made,
natural vs artificial,
feel vs know,
physis and pathos,
body and mind,
rule and exception,
noise and signal.

logic expression [talking]
can be interpreted as a 'mating call'
= search for peers.
if not answered [frustrated]
one alone must find an answer [false feedback, monolog].
= 'help your self'
= pushing into loneliness,
away from 'mutual completion'.
a true friend will take your weakness with his strength = completion.
only an enemy will use your weakness for his profit.

example: element fire.
while 'born fire' is a 'natural authority'
and has a feeling for order
= a talent for dominance and selection ..
every 'made fire' 
will only reproduce its learned knowledge.
this is the contrast of 'living gods' vs 'dead gods',
of 'true intelligence' vs 'artificial intelligence'.
look at the Lebowski Dude [Jeff Bridges] as 'born fire'.
signs of 'made fire' are
shortsight = greed for quick profit,
insecurity = explore step by step. 
[Hard Moral]
made fire = OCD = obsessive compulsive disorder.
made = disorder, fake, weakness.
born = personality, strength.

the problem?
feelings tend to be 'weaker' than knowledge,
in a 'culture' [style of education]
that rewards knowledge, and represses feelings.
also,
normopathy [sick majority] 
gives 'false security' to sick ones.
[Group Narcism]
also,
'sensation seeking' rewards the sick ones.
also,
the switch to Secondary Type
was too long ago, so they prefer:
rather change never than late.
possible escapes are:
1. hallucinogens like DMT.
2. TRE = trauma releasing exercises.
both must be used only in a 'good setting'
so one can find the natural peers.
but:
feeling = talent = natural strength = potential = gift.
False Education will always
1. prevent bonding with 'natural peers'
   = push into 'next plus one' states,
   preferrably into the 'introvert' or 'neurotic' state.
2. compensate weakness to 'false security'.
= divide et impera, divide and conquer.
aka Naturalism vs Materialsim:
frustrate natural needs,
compensate with 'dead gods' = material goods
= food, drugs, clothes, toys.
only ugly and weak bodies need clothes to hide.

paradox, rebel, provoke, permanent state of exception, normopathy:
destroy natural order [strong, rule],
and replace with made order [weak, exception].



Melting Pot vs. Cultural Mosaic.

mixed community vs. gated community.
mixing different cultures
is a source of constant Stress.
[see Typical Stress Response]
having a 'homogen community' aka 'closed society'
is privilege for the rich elite.
'the paradise of the rich ones
is made from the hell of the poor ones.'
also, mixed groups have a much higher demand
for 'made order' as in 'police state'.
the 'clash of cultures' generates crime
which generates jobs for police.



all crime is privilege.

'thou shalt not steal' -- but i can!
= the difference between 'you people' and 'me people',
between Slave Moral and Hard Moral.
or: to fight criminals,
police must stand above 'the law',
for Equality Of Arms.



Education [vs. Initiation?]

note how 'civilization' 
[in contrast to primitive culture]
does overrate Education [forced correction]
knowledge and status.
this simply is 'ageism'
= age discrimination
= old over young
= rich over poor
= know over feel
= only kids must learn / follow / change.

this is one way to justify 'made fire',
to justify 'false authority'.



another contrast is Class:

Romantics vs Classics.
rational vs irrational.
realist vs idealist.
sane vs crazy.
shortsight vs farsight.
childish vs mature.
humans vs animals.
smart vs dumb.
open mind vs narrow mind.
bisexual vs bipolar.
deaf vs blind.
eyes vs ears.
in elements:
Air + Water vs Fire + Earth.
3 + 4 vs 1 + 2.
7 vs 12.
G vs R.
[G is letter 7,
and combines circle + cross.]
in functions:
Think + Feel vs Intuit + Sense.
or:
Chaos vs Order
the dream of a 'class less society'
needs to exterminate a whole class,
mostly the class of classics.

classics = bipolar
= bridge between the two poles = moods.
romantics = bisexual
= bridge between the two sexes
= between patriarchy and matriarchy.

the switch to 'next plus one' state
is always a switch of Class.
born romantics play fake classics,
and
born classics play fake romantics.
fake classic = made order
= human written laws, science, etc.
romantics explore with 'trial and error'.
romantic = shortsight, dynamic, fugitive.

Class aka 'outer tempo'.
in contrast to 'inner tempo' = choleric or phlegmatic.
why?
cos mood [sanguinic or melancholic]
and tempo [choleric or phlegmatic]
have similar direction,
they are NOT orthogonal.
sanguinic mood is similar to choleric tempo,
melancholic mood is similar to phlegmatic tempo.
lets translate this similarity to signs:
sanguinic and choleric are positive,
melancholic and phlegmatic are negative:
[translation to Old Alchemy, body humor combinations:]
3. Air = sanguinic choleric = + x +.
1. Fire = sanguinic phlegmatic = + x -.
2. Earth = melancholic choleric = - x +.
4. Water = melancholic phlegmatic = - x -.
result + = Romantic.
result - = Classic.
Sanguinic Mood = self love, leader, commander, resistant to insults.
Choleric Tempo = quick response, neurotic.

Same First vs Other First.
Romantics seek strong bond [first bond]
with the same element [homopolar], of other sex [gender].
.. and weak bond [second bond]
with 'same mood' but 'different tempo'.
R.s they bring short-term equality 
[trade economy, revenge justice]
and produce long-term chaos
[decadence, system crash, hell].
Classics seek strong bond
with 'other mood' and 'other tempo' [bipolar]
.. and weak bond
with 'same mood' but 'different tempo'.
C.s bring short-term 'chaos'
and produce long-term stability
[heaven]

Left vs. Right.
multiple translations seem valid.
1. Right = Patriarchy = Gender Congruent Body Types = "the good swastika".
2. Right = Melancholics.
3. Right = Hard Moral = fire ideal.
4. Right = own group [Group Narcism]
5. Right = Classics.
6. Right = Fire.
7. Right = primitive culture, naturalism.
8. Right = water, Left = air, Up = earth, Down = fire. [Mobile Swastika]

Extravert vs Introvert vs Ambivert.
in my view:
Air = Extravert = romantic leader.
Fire = Introvert = classic leader.
Water + Earth = Ambivert = followers.

Fire is also called 'arrogant'
cos it will never ask [latin rogare = to ask],
and always only answer, or command.
fire is a born oracle, o-raa-cle



Typical Stress Response.

this part was inspired by the buffalo herd order.

in Time Of Stress [threat from outside],
Romantics hide in the center [invisible, black],
Classics are pushed outside [visible, white] = Romantic Center.

in Time Of Peace [outside bears opportunity]
Romantics explore outside [fake friends],
Classics go to center [homies] = Classic Center.

X = center = Romantics in stress.
O = outside = Classics in stress.

In center,
two opposites join for temporal unity.
Time Of Stress: F3--M3 + F4--M4 [other + other]
Time Of Peace: F1--M2 + M1--F2 [same + same]
so,
Romantics seek equality first, contrast second.
Classics seek contrast first, equality second.



Class Justice, Double Moral.

in made order,
Romantics are always preferred,
#todo



Emancipation. Dualism. Tantra.

Mutual Completion. Both Sides.
Balance Of Powers.
Romantics act more 'masculine' like Mars [martial arts],
Classics act more 'feminine' like Venus.
= group gender.
true 'emancipation'
would replace individuals
with 'groups of eight'
to represent all eight types.
or at least M1 + F1
= patriarch + matriarch
= king + queen.



Empire vs Pagans.

Large State and Small States.
Church vs Sects.
Sect as in Person Cult, Small State, Monastery, Gated Community.
see Separation of Church and State.
Civilization vs Primitives.
Republic vs Monarchy.
open system vs. closed system.
large states vs. small states.
remote control vs. self organization.
kill other gods vs. kill other weaks.
sabotage vs. coexistence.
#todo

empire = authoritarian = collectivist.
the empire does occupy colonies,
with the excuse of 'natural chaos'
and a better 'made order'.
that 'made order' 
must be built and protected by force,
[ militant pacifist, fucking for virginity ]
and must be paid for by taxes = by the slaves.
see Hard Moral.





translation to Power Distance and Geert Hofstede.

distant power = empire = large group = normopathy, morality, small families, broken "inner structure" is compensated with "strong government", over-strict, hostility, distrust, anonymity, symbol union, "culture of fear", leaders tend to hide their "ruler knowledge" and tend to sabotage the recruiting of new leaders, greed for profit / short-term success / opportunism.

close power = cult = small group, with mostly complete "inner structure" = close to the Circle Of Eight = close to Natural Order, healthy "extended families", born leaders are easily recruited to made leaders and employed in positions of power, search for long-term stability and strong relations.




Small State.

Tribalism in the sense of 
small paganistic spirtual communties 
caring for eachothers wellbeing 
making due of simple life
#todo



Slave Moral vs. Hard Moral.

see Friedrich Nietzsche, Sklavenmoral vs Herrenmoral.
fire = hard = heart = [german:] herz = herr.
slave moral = 'we are all element earth' = earth ideal.
hard moral = 'we are all element fire' = fire ideal.
earth ideal in public [idiot safe space]
= introvert romantics follow born earth.
fire ideal in private*
= extravert romantics follow born fire.
*private person cult, secret ruler knowledge,
secret societies.
born fire = devil in public, enemy of the state.
Hard Moral tends to steal all good,
to use it as attractor, bait, pull factor, dead god = sex sells,
.. and to spread all bad, 
as push factor, negative motivation, punishment.
= Strategy Of Tension, Crowd Control.
every 'criminal offense' is only a privilege for the elite.
Slave Moral is forced on the majority,
for the goal of profit maximization
= many slaves, small elite.
'the paradise of the rich ones
is made from the hell of the poor ones.'
Judaism is a supremacist ideology 
with thousands of Talmudic laws on 
how to manage non-Jewish slaves.
[most important, how to educate kids to be slaves.]
slave moral = no one is "responsible" [in our group].
hard moral = every one is "responsible" [in our group].
responsible = dominant = fire.



Collectivism vs Individualism.

multiple translations:

1. C = Slave Moral, I = Hard Moral
2. C = Gender Opposing, I = Gender Congruent
3. C = melancholic mood, I = sanguinic mood

collectivist ideal: trustworthy, honest, generous, sensitive, team work, cooperation, community man.
individualist ideal: assertive, strong, competition, artistic, bohemian.



Masculinity index. masculine vs feminine

multiple translations:

1. M = romantic center, F = classic center
2. M = psychotic, F = neurotic
3. M = sanguinic, F = melancholic

M: assert, hunt, compete, expand, fight, aggress, work, start wars, impatient, business over art, radical: destroy + build new, action, dominate in mild climate, intensive farming, industry, innovate, explore, modern, greed, hyper-active, much work + little life, work for fun, sportive, playful

F: nurture, heal, repair, gather, relate, lazy, defend, protect environment, diplomacy, art over business, plan, organize, settle, dominate in hard climate, extensive farming, tradition, oldschool, hyper-passive, little work + much life, work to survive, mature

M: japan, USA, germans, ireland, UK, mexico, italy
F: sweden, NL, spain, thailand, korea, portugal, middle east, west africa

most people have to grow up without 'born leaders',
and are trained to follow 'made leaders',
and maybe later they can be 'made leaders' too.
'made leaders' only lead for a short time [election cycle],
and they only lead in their field of expertise.
but 'perfection' is more than a 'sum of partial solutions'.
integrity is the natural talent of element fire.
.... to organize 'social integrity'
and to 'bring together who belongs together'.
mating. coupling. mediating.
'the [bad] media' do the opposite:
they divide those, who belong together,
and they 'sublimate' natural attraction forces
into 'motivation to self-harm'.
[motivation psychology, rape and pull, reverted escape]



Humanistic Euthanasia

another sign of Hard Moral is Humanistic Euthanasia.
= to get rid off 'bad guys'
they ban bad guys away from public territory,
into loneliness = isolation,
so they either starve to death,
or apologize and come back.
romantics always overrate learning and education.
aka 'forced exorcism' = beat the shit out of a bad guy.
[for 'better exorcism' see TRE = Trauma Releasing Exercises.]
romantics feel 'nature is chaos' and must be controlled.
= all humans are born equal [egalitee, tabula rasa]
and must be educated, as in:
rewarded for good, punished for bad behavior.
= conditioning, brain washing.
also,
sterilization is Humanistic Euthanasia.
= kill their kids.



Group Narcism.

all 'groups' offer security for their members.
in return, members see their group as good,
or better than other [neighbor] groups.
other groups can serve as scapegoat
= projection of self critic.



Heritage. Caste System.
#todo

Ethic Of Intention. Gesinnungs Ethik.
False Patience. Endless Cycles.
when romantics produce chaos,
they as true opportunists
will excuse with:
at least i had good intentions.
Intention vs Response.
idea vs realization.
image vs real.
another way to 'escape from responsibility'
is False Patience:
they will make you wait forever.
they will promise a better future,
but they will never deliver.
[see Perfect Hoax]



Internal Gender.

every element prefers one gender.
in my symbolism,
this is seen on the bottom.
male elements have pointy bottoms:
heart + cross = fire + water.
female elements have round bottoms:
pear + circle = earth + air.
if the 'outer gender'
is same as the 'inner gender',
the type is a
Gender Congruent Body Type,
or is part of the Patriarchy half.



Astrology.

calendar astrology only works for 1 in 4.
why?
cos element and gender are random!
and not corelated with birth time.
still, astrology is useful.
the 12 zodiac signs
are 4 elements x 3 modalities.
4 elements:
3. air = libra, gemini, aquarius.
1. fire = aries, leo, sagittarius.
2. earth = virgo, taurus, capricorn.
4. water = pisces, scorpio, cancer.
3 modalities:
cardinal + mutable + fixed.
my translation?
modality mutable = natural type.
modalities cardinal + fixed = secondary types.
astrology literature
provides tons of details
to the four elements.
some details can be ignored.
public texts [Slave Moral, earth ideal]
will always focus on 'positive aspects'.
negative aspects
are hidden away from public
to Hard Moral [fire ideal] and secret societies.



Four Vocals.

-ee- = Air,
-aa- = Fire,
-oo- = Earth,
-uu- = Water.
-ii- = Fifth Element? = Spirit, Group, Ring, System.
[air could be -ii- as well.]
why the notation of -xx-?
cos, names are made of 3 syllables.
my name is mi-laa-no,
aa = long vocal, i + o = short vocals.
the 'main signal' is in the center syllable,
start + end syllables only 'fill the void'.
other names:
he-lee-na, don-huu-go, a-doo-nis, ta-maa-ra,
ra-moo-na, li-mee-ro,

Euthanasia vs World War.

organized retreat vs chaotic collapse.
close combat vs distant weapons.
born fire = eugenics AND euthanasia
= genius AND madman.
made fire destroys this balance.
in peace time,
eugenics [work] is rewarded
and euthanasia is repressed.
.. repressed until the next war
= all poor and unworthy are killed,
with 'distant weapons'.

so to really prevent war,
born fire must regularly 
kill [sacrifce] other humans.
.. either of its own tribe,
or of neighbor tribes.

but actual murder
is only the second step in 'hunting'.
the first step is done by born air.
air can 'win' the prey,
capture it and bring it to fire.
fire will then rule over life and death of the prey.
= decide if it is worthy to live, or not.

born fire brings quick and peaceful death,
made fire prefers torture and rape [rape culture],
to search [provoke] born fire.
[to stop the pain, to redeem the prey = mercy kill.]



Systematic Procrastination.

hunting for small fish is so much easier.
distraction from bigger problems.
street crime as scapegoat for white collar crime.
#todo



Remote Control. Crowd Control.

Strategy Of Tension.
Mutation and Selection.
romantic slaves [Slave Moral] 
explore with 'trial and error'.
they randomly visit all directions,
and learn from short-term success.
romantic leaders [Hard Moral]
only punish 'bad moves' [minority],
all others are tolerated [majority]
and indirectly rewarded with freedom.
so the 'good slaves' enjoy freedom
and try to inspire other slaves
with their 'recipe for success'.
in contrast,
all 'bad slaves' who try to do 'bad moves'
are punished by the slave collective = mob rule.
#todo five monkeys experiment hoax



Shitstorm Incoming.

some people will reduce my work to
'you only want to be a legal serial killer.'
and they are right,
but i also want to be a 'serial father'.
eugenics AND euthanasia, in balance.
and not only I, but all element fire.
we need more leaders, and less slaves.
= the opposite of 'profit maximization'.



Majority Vote. Mob Rule.

Group Think. Democracy.
made fire always
only represents a majority,
never the wholeness = entity.
only born fire
will find 'perfect solutions'
to serve the whole eco system,
and not only 'humanity'.



Totalitar vs Perfect.

to FORCE majority to 'fake entity',
made fire must murder all born fire.
as in witch hunts.
burn the witch = punish born fire with made fire.
also 'jews' were burned in nazi camps.
INRI = Iustum Necar Reges Impios [jesuit oath]
= it is good to murder kings lacking respect.
.. respect for made fire = fake kings.
killing born fire is a way
to get rid off competitors, and maximize profit.
remember public vs private:
in public, all 'made fire' must be worshipped.
only in private, critic is tolerated.
[maybe i should join some secret society.]
perfect = whole = hermetic = complete = circle = closed.



Intensive vs. Extensive

extensive = casual, easy, loving, lazy, effective, use amplification, minimal culture.
intensive = the hard way, forced, brutal, hateful.



Diffusion vs. Osmosis.

limit, border, membrane
passive vs active
follow vs control
#todo



Common Grounds.

1. same class.
2. same mood.
3. same congruency = Matriarchy or Patriarchy.
4. same gender.
no common ground is 'inner tempo' = choleric or phlegmatic.
every one of the eight types has exactly one 'opposite type'
with zero common ground.
to find that 'opposite type',
1. switch mood.
2. switch gender
3. switch class.
or:
1. keep inner tempo
2. switch mood
3. switch gender.
so, opposite types are:
F3 vs M2
M1 vs F4
F2 vs M3
M4 vs F1
these share zero 'common ground'
and will never feel sympathy.



Black Sheep and White Wolf.

many families have a 'black sheep' kid.
it simply feels strange,
and this 'antipathy' [feeling of distance]
will produce endless conflict.
'if you love then let go.'
but,
let go to where?
in past times, to a monastery.
today, to jail or psychiatry.
just,
why not find a better family?
'my enemys friend'
'my two enemies could be friends'
if your child is your 'enemy'
and another family is your 'enemy',
chances are good,
your 'strange' kid would love that other family.



Perfect Hoax.

made order, and all 'ideologies'
promise a better future
but will never deliver.
they are a waste of time.
or,
you must die to find the truth.
also,
'near death experiences'
and 'ego death' trips from hallucinogens
must be censored away from public.
in general,
all comparison is forbidden,
all opposition is infiltrated and sabotaged.
only small deviations are tolerated,
you have the choice between shit and shit.
[South Park: Vote Or Die]



Anarchists.

anarchists are 'archs' them selves.
arch = heart = fire = prime.
#todo or: arch = psychotic, patri-arch = male psychotics?
just like atheists are gods them selves = heretics.
both oppose 'false authority' and 'dead gods'.
cos the 'natural work' of born fire
is ruined by made fire.
farsight is sacrificed for short-term profit.
born fire is only needed as scapegoat for the next recession.
= when it is too late for prevention and farsight.



Fire Test. False Expectations.

in witch hunts, born fire is burned in made fire.
if it survives, it is a devil, or a god.
if it dies, it was only a human.
see Perfect Hoax.



Racism vs Race Mixing.

racism and inbreeding
are censored as Hard Moral for the elite.
but racism is a tendency of Classics,
who seek to stabilize one phenotype.
in sociology,
racism = cultural mosaic, gated communities.
race mixing = melting pot, open borders.
classics = racists are 'blind'
= they seek 'optic uniform'
in contrast to romantics who are 'deaf'
= they seek 'symbol uniform' [german: Sprachgemeinschaft]
= 'one nation under a symbol' = romantic center.
Race Mixing is one way to prevent Physiognomics
= to hide 'typical' body shapes.
for example, breed 'jews' with smaller noses.
[the typical 'jew nose' [long + convex] shows element water.]
also Plastic Surgery can hide body signs.



Eugenics Rules.

1. separate generations.
allow breeding only every 5 years, for example,
to allow more kids of same age to 'grow up together'.
2. only 'strong bond' pairs should breed.
3. let the kids decide, who they bond to,
both to other kids of same age,
but also to 'parents' of old age.
kids need proximity to all eight types.
[if you love, then let go,
and what is yours, will return to you.]
4. allow kids to play and sleep together.
do not force them to sleep alone.
we all sleep better with our partner.
[if they find sex on their own, why not?]



Cover Noise and Hidden Signals.

Chaffing and Winnowing.
Steganography.
the elite loves 'hiding in plain sight'.
pushing desinformation is one way
to hide Hard Moral = secret ruler knowledge.
most 'esoteric and occult' scripts are desinformation 
aka cover noise, distraction, spam, encryption, sabotage.
encrypt = hide signal in cover noise.
mostly they show up in numbers.
examples?
i was in jail for exact 33 months.
all my court hearings were at 9 o clock. 9 = 3 x 3.
the 'sum of digits' of my court dates are 7 = romantics.
they placed 'fake evidence' in my friends home,
and the weight of the bag was exact my birthday.
they punished my friend as 'jew helper',
cos he offered me refuge for some time.
back to Cover Noise.
cover noise is any nonsense
that puts the 'weak minded' into sleep.
but from time to time,
they place Hidden Signals,
as trigger or reminder.
also 'system crash' and 'war'
serve as Cover Noise, to
a. get rid off enemy leaders [devils]
b. occupy resources cheap.



Security By Obscurity.

Reality Obfuscation. Closed Source.
Remote Control. No One Is Responsible.
Dead God Cults hide Person Cults.
so the ruling elite can always escape from responsibility
by saying: 'we did this for humanity'
[or any other 'dead god' or ideal].
and: 'we all are only servants'. [anarchy?]
scapegoats [small fish] are sacrificed as 'responsible ones'
to satisfy the mob [romantic slaves?].
also,
hiding Hard Moral does weaken rivals,
[monopoles hate all rivals]
and does increase profit.
[secret recipe for success]

to distract slaves from 'real problems',
masters create 'pseudo problems'.
this is an effective solution in the short term,
but when the 'real problems' get bigger,
the 'distraction machine' grows bigger,
which will further increase the 'waste of energy',
and increase the 'real problems'.
= the 'vicious circle' of distraction and waste.
= 'blind activism'



Climate Selects Culture.

three climate zones:
1. tropic
2. moderate
3. polar.
in tropic climate, romantics dominate.
in moderate climate, you see 'clash of cultures'.
in polar climate, classics dominate.
from tropic to polar, from hell to heaven.
colonization tried to bring classic culture to tropic climate.
migration from africa to europe tries to bring romantic culture to moderate and polar climate. [sweden is one example for polar climate]
both are 'weapons of migration', destructive to the target culture.



Heretics. Prepare For The Worst.

consider this information as a leak.
spreading this 'truth' in public
will lead to punishment.
heretics = low status element fire,
who is claiming privileges,
like its natural right to murder.
INRI = iustum necare reges impios
= it is right to kill kings who lack respect.
this is secret information for the private domain.
= Hard Moral.



Information Technology.

trying to solve the conflict of
distance and proximity.
in short, you cant!
you can never have proximity aka trust
to some one who is far away from you.
far away in miles or years.
no one can prove jesus christ,
or what he said.
plus, you have no feedback channel
to clarify ambiguities,
to get answer to your questions.
of course you can try to ask = pray,
but you will never get an answer.
except for hallucinations or [synthetic] telepathy
aka someone else playing with you [remote control].

Allah gave the Jinn the free will to obey or disobey Him like man.
The majority of the Jinn are Kuffar.
15. The Angles are generally described with praise worthy traits. 
Most of the Jinn are described as being whispers of evil, plotters, deceivers, and oppressors.
16. The Angels aren’t described as being neither male nor female. 
The Jinn are male and female.

NWO. New World Order.

A One World Government and one-unit monetary system, under permanent non-elected hereditary oligarchists who self-select from among their numbers in the form of a feudal system as it was in the Middle Ages.
population will be limited
There will be no middle class, only rulers and the servants.
those who are obedient and subservient to the One World Government will be rewarded with the means to live; those who are rebellious will simple be starved to death or be declared outlaws, thus a target for anyone who wishes to kill them.
The magnitude of deceit in this conspiracy is mind boggling
Most people react with disbelief
unaware that they have been conditioned (brainwashed) to react with skepticism by institutional and media influences that were created by the Mother of All mind control organizations: The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. 
[trigger words, taboo topics, end of debate/peace, signal for war]
Author and de-programmer Fritz Springmeier (The Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines ) says that most people have built in "slides" that short circuit the mind's critical examination process when it comes to certain sensitive topics. 
"Slides", Springmeier reports, is a CIA term for a conditioned type of response which dead ends a person's thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic. For example, the mention of the word "conspiracy" usually solicits a slide response with many people.
[manufactured consent, majority vote]
What most Americans believe to be "Public Opinion" is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. Public opinion polls are really taken with the intent of gauging the public's acceptance of the Illuminati's mind controlled programs. A strong showing in the polls tells the Illuminati that the programing is "taking", while a poor showing tells the NWO manipulators that they have to recast or "tweak" the programming until the desired response is achieved.
[strategy of tension]
The NWO global conspirators manifest their agenda through the skillful manipulation of human emotions, especially fear.



#todo condense. make this shorter.
Problem, Reaction, and Solution.

Problem = conflict, argument, dualism
The technique is as follows: 
Illuminati strategists create the Problem- 
by funding , assembling, and training an "opposition" group to stimulate turmoil in an established political power (sovereign country, region, continent, etc.) that they wish to impinge upon and thus 
create opposing factions in a conflict that the Illuminati themselves maneuvered into existence. In recent decades, so called 
"opposition" groups are usually identified in the media as 'freedom fighters' or 'liberators' (most recently
the KLA-Kosovo Liberation Army). At the same time, 
the leader of the established political power where the conflict is being orchestrated is demonized and, on cue, referred to as 'another Hitler' (take your pick: Saddam Hussein, Milosevic, Kadaffi, Osama bin-Laden etc.). 
The 'freedom fighters' are not infrequently assembled from a local criminal element (i.e. KLA, drug traffickers). 
In the spirit of true Machiavellian deceit, the same NWO strategists are equally involved in covertly arming and advising the leader of the established power as well (the Illuminati always profits from any armed conflict by loaning money, arming, and supplying ALL parties involved in a war).

Reaction = fear, 'free us from evil'
The conflict is drawn to the world stage by the controlled media outlets with a barrage of photos and video tape reports of horrific and bloody atrocities suffered by innocent civilians. The cry goes up "Something has to be done!" And That is the desired Reaction (note: the same technique is presently being used to bring about gun control in the United States).

Solution = restore peace, unity .. brought by a 'third party'
The NWO puppeteers then provide the Solution by sending in UN 'Peace Keepers' (Bosnia) or a UN 'Coalition Force' (Gulf War) or NATO Bombers and then ground troops (Kosovo). Once installed, the 'peace keepers' never leave (Bosnia). 
The idea is to have NWO controlled ground troops in all major countries or strategic areas 
where significant resistance to the New World Order takeover is likely to be encountered.
[sabotage]

The local, sovereign military force is either defeated (i.e. Yugoslavia) or, as in the case of the United States, replaced by foreign UN "Partnership For Peace" (PFP) troops who take over the jobs of US soldiers who have been sent overseas on 'peacekeeping' missions.

Child Sacrifice.

another sign of Hard Moral.
members of the elite will participate
in ritual child sacrifice.
the more Intensive, the better.
= spectacular, torture, rape, carnage.
background:
element fire does murder 'unwanted children'
so parents can focus all their energy on 'wanted kids'.
born fire does 'mercy kill' = put to sleep with poison = peaceful death.
the 'pro life' ideal
is one way to sabotage families,
to force them to also raise 'unwanted kids',
who will in turn always hate their parents
[for not killing them in the first place,
and not giving them a 'good life'.]

child murder, cannibalism
= hard moral, fake fire.



Hot and Cold.
air is the first to freeze = loves summer,
fire will freeze top first [head, chest],
earth will freeze bottom first [feet, ass],
water is the last to freeze = loves winter = cUUl. [i hate that vowel shift.]



middle class = classics = mesomorph.
ruling class = romantics with fire ideal [hard moral],
working class = romantics with earth ideal [slave moral].
enemy of the communist state is element fire = devil in public.

the lie of Calendar Astrology.
not all astrology is fake.
but one part is: Calendar Astrology
= birth time dictates element.
this only works in 1 of 4,
cos element is chosen by random,
and all elements are equally frequent.

translation to Carl Jung aka CG Jung.

4. Water = F. Feeling = pessimism.

translation to Hans Eysenck.

"The factor of neuroticism constitutes a biological unit"

"neurotic predisposition is to a large extent determined."

neuroticism = neurotic tempo.
extraversion = extravert mood.

Psychoticism = B5C + B5A 
= Big Five Conscientiousness and Big Five Agreeableness.

impulsive = extravert or neurotic [neurotic!].

Hans Eysenck translation to Immanuel Kant.
1. fire  = PE = Galen sanguine type
2. earth = NI = Galen melancholic type
3. air   = NE = Galen choleric type
4. water = PI = Galen phlegmatic type
--> tempo over mood, air is more similar to earth than to fire.

Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused 
by variability in cortical arousal: 
"introverts are characterized by 
higher levels of activity than extraverts 
and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts".[39] 
Similarly, Eysenck proposed that 
location within the neuroticism dimension 
was determined by individual differences 
in the limbic system.[40] 
While it seems counterintuitive to suppose 
that introverts are more aroused than extraverts, 
the putative effect this has on behaviour is such that 
the introvert seeks lower levels of stimulation. 
Conversely, 
the extravert seeks to heighten his or her arousal 
to a more favourable level 
(as predicted by the Yerkes-Dodson Law) 
by increased activity, social engagement 
and other stimulation-seeking behaviours. 

[ introversion = melancholic mood or psychotic tempo or classic class ]

"against the equality of people" = "The Inequality of Man" = "racist" = Hard Moral or classic class.

equality: potential vs success.
success: short- vs long-term.

"Equality of social status has always been a socialist idea, 
and it is certainly possible to argue 
about its desirability, or the possibility of achieving it. 
Equality of biological abilities and traits is a chimera 
which no thinking person should entertain for one moment."

2. earth = Galen melancholic type
3. air   = Galen choleric type
4. water = Galen phlegmatic type

While the term temperament 
came to refer just to psychological dispositions, 
Galen used it to refer to bodily dispositions, 
which determined a person's

as well as behavioral and emotional inclinations.

b. sublime = neurotic tempo

1. fire  = Sanguine = beauty = neurotic romantic
2. earth = Melancholic = beauty and sublime = neurotic classic

translation to Doshas and Enneagram.

http://www.goconscious.com/home/articles/correlations_between_enneagram_type_and_ayurvedic_dosha_an_exploratory_pilot_study.html

Vata = water = index finger
creative, quick-moving, and erratic. They benefit from nourishing and routine.
Type Four, Type Six, and the Vata Dosha
Four and Six are reactive Enneagram types with an erratic nature also found in the Vata dosha. Vata-dominant individuals easily become ungrounded. This is true of both Enneagram types; Fours have weak Gut Centers and easily become absorbed in fantasies, while Sixes lose touch with their inner guidance--their internal “ground”--and can drift from one source of authority to another.

Pitta = classics = fire + earth
Types One, Three, and the Pitta Dosha
sharp, driven, and irritable. They benefit from calming and moderation.
Types One and Three are driven, energetic Enneagram types, as is characteristic of the Pitta dosha. Like Pitta-dominant individuals, both of these types are action-oriented and are susceptible to overdoing and burnout. Ones and Threes also share the Pitta trait of being highly perfectionistic and feeling frustrated when they are not succeeding.

Kapha = air = ring finger
generous, steady, and possessive. They benefit from stimulation and expression.
Types Nine, Two, and the Kapha Dosha
Type Nine shares the slow, steady pace and unflappability of the Kapha dosha. As a body-centered type, it’s interesting to note that Nine was the only Enneagram type to show a positive physical correlation to any dosha. Type Two shares Kapha’s loving, possessive, people-oriented quality.

translation to Colin DeYoung big five abstraction.

stability = JDA = classic = ability to maintain __stable__ relationships, motivation and emotional states.

He offers that this general ability may be linked to the rostral serotonergic system which in turn has been linked to emotion and motivation regulation.[11] Reductions in a serotonin variant in the region of the midbrain associated with this system have been linked to "aggressiveness (low Agreeableness) and impulsiveness (low Conscientiousness and low Emotional Stability)"[10]

[ low serotonin = romantic OR air ]

plasticity = JDB = extravert = cognitive flexibility = John Digman beta factor = extraversion + openness = "young age" = learn easy.

He hypothesizes links to the central dopaminergic (DA) system. Extraversion had been previously linked to the DA system.[12] In addition, extraversion and openness to experience are both linked to latent inhibition reduction[10] which is moderated by the DA system.[13] These underlying biological correlates combined with DeYoung's conceptual arguments form the foundation of his case for "stability" and "plasticity" as labels and interpretations of Digman's Alpha and Beta factors.

translation to Janek Musek and General Factor Of Personality.

aka "The Big One" personality factor.

good = desirable = attractive = air = optimism + motivation = self love + activity = extravert + neurotic.

optimism scale: air > fire > earth > water.

this confirms my assumption of "mood over tempo", as in: air is more similar to fire than to earth, and water is more similar to earth than to fire.

also, this "big one" factor assumes "classic center".
if you assume "romantic center", then you get a complementary "big one" factor of "dominance":

dominance scale: fire > air > water > earth = sanguinic scale with romantic center.

classicism scale: fire > earth > water > air = 'dryness' = class scale with melancholic center.

psychotic tempo [or dominance]
= eclectic not conventional = dissident = nonconformist = heretic
= syncretic not special 
= 'natural order' 
= genius = ghost = strong mind 
= self-aware = metacognition

= polymath = universal = many interests 
= [classic: naturally social] = [classic: few strong bonds] 
= natural science = interdisciplinary = transcendental 
= [classic: middle class] = [classic: perfectionist].

antiauthoritarian education:
The idea of a universal education was essential 
to achieving polymath ability, 
hence the word university was used 
to describe a seat of learning. 
At this time, 
universities did not specialize in specific areas, 
but rather trained students in a broad array of 
science, philosophy and theology. 
This universal education gave them 
a grounding 
from which they could continue into apprenticeship 
toward becoming a master of a specific field.

Complementarity
Complementarity in social psychology 
is defined on the basis of 
the interpersonal circle (Carson, 1969), 
according to which interpersonal behaviors 
fall on a circle with two dimensions, namely 

dominance (i.e. dominant–submissive) and 
warmth (i.e. hostile–friendly). 

It states that each interpersonal behavior 
invites certain responses of another interactant. 
The behavior and the response it invites 
are said to be complementary 
(Horowitz, Dryer, & Krasnoperova, 1997) 
when friendly behavior begets hostile behavior, 
and dominant behavior begets submissive behavior. 
When people fail to give the invited response, 
it is said to be a non-complementary interaction. 
If the first person's behavior 
invites a reaction from the second person 
that matches the second person's goals, 
then the second person is satisfied; 
otherwise, the second person is frustrated 
(Dryer & Horowitz, 1997).

old age is similar to melancholic mood.




Guardians are concrete and organized (scheduled). Seeking security and belonging, they are concerned with responsibility and duty. Their greatest strength is logistics. They excel at organizing, facilitating, checking, and supporting. The two roles are as follows:

Administrators are the directive (proactive) Guardians. Their most developed intelligence operation is regulating. The attentive Inspectors and the expressive Supervisors are the two role variants.
Conservators are the informative (reactive) Guardians. Their most developed intelligence operation is supporting. The attentive Protectors and the expressive Providers are the two role variants.

Idealists are abstract and compassionate. Seeking meaning and significance, they are concerned with personal growth and finding their own unique identity. Their greatest strength is diplomacy. They excel at clarifying, individualizing, unifying, and inspiring. The two roles are as follows:

Mentors are the directive (proactive) Idealists. Their most developed intelligence operation is developing. The attentive Counselors and the expressive Teachers are the two role variants.
Advocates are the informative (reactive) Idealists. Their most developed intelligence operation is mediating. The attentive Healers and the expressive Champions are the two role variants.

a < b < c < d = water < earth < fire < air = mood scale with classic center



infiltration

all types do corelate gender and tempo.
in the right side, males are psychotic, and so on.
the difference is,
psychotics 'can' be aware of that bias,
and can (ab-) use it, to infiltrate neurotics on the 'other side'.
[neurotics are much more 'sexist',
as in, they can not control their 'gender is tempo' bias.]
to infiltrate,
the psychotic must play his neurotic pathos:
fire play air, water play earth.
13 = 143, 42 = 412.
these pathos roles call for 'the other psychotic' of same gender.
fire (need water) play air, water (need fire) play earth.
probably, that other psychotic must be absent for this play.
[ = horizontal infiltration to 'other side']

speculation:
psychotics feel 'tempo over mood',
neurotics feel 'mood over tempo'?
this is why neurotics are 
easy to infiltrate by 'psychotic play neurotic'.
reciproke,
psychotics are more 'mood blind'
and should be
easy to infiltrate by 'other-mood play same-mood'.
[ = vertical infiltration to 'other age']
fire (sanguinic mood)
could be infiltrated by 213 (or 431).
water (melancholic mood)
could be infiltrated by 342 (or 124).

the term 'infiltration' sounds rather negative.
as all 'technology', this can be used for good or bad.
these might be communication channels
between 'left side' and 'right side',
while psychotics tend to 'control' or 'respond',
and neurotics tend to 'report' or 'ask'.
#todo remove



Left Side and Right Side.

left  = gender opposing types  = F1 M2 M3 F4
right = gender congruent types = M1 F2 F3 M4

communication between left and right side
is done by the Romantic Center in time of stress,
and by the Classic Center in time of peace.



colors

1. fire  = yellow
2. earth = green
3. air   = red
4. water = blue

classic = yellow + green = lime = light
romantic = red + blue = purple = dark

taking the 'red pill'
= classics switch
from 'introvert pathos' = play water
to 'extravert pathos' = play air.
= activation, stimulation, wake up.



sleep state vs wake state.

when all types in a quartet
play their 'introvert pathos'
= 'melancholic mood'
at the same time,
then their 'pathos arrows' form a 'down spiral'.



sleep state of the bottom-left quartet:

      4─┐
┌─────┐ │
4 ┌─3 2 │
  │ 4 1─┘ 2
  │ └─────┘ 
  └─2

the sleep state
in the bottom octet [classic center],
shows a 'left swastika'

with the four arms pointing counter-clockwise,
with opposite arms forming the character Z,
hence 'ZZ swastika'.

this is the symbol of 'mass hypnosis',
'opium for the masses' [alcohol],
dumbing down, mass destruction,
melting pot, egalitarianism,
avoid conflict, overrate conformism,
false patience, bad sleep, over passive,
forced peace with depressant agents,
mass sabotage, naive hope for the best,
confusion, uncertainty, agnostic,
'melancholic ideal', weak and lazy,
adrenal fatigue, rest and digest response,
sleepwalkers, dreamers, dropouts,
dogma of blasphemy, ignorance,
'they live + we sleep',
all are receiving, but no one is sending,
passive loneliness.



wake state of the bottom-left quartet:

  ┌─1
  │ ┌─────┐
  │ 3 2─┐ 1
3 └─4 1 │ 
└─────┘ │
      3─┘

the wake state
in the bottom octet [classic center],
shows a 'right swastika'
with the four arms pointing clockwise,
with opposite arms forming the character S,
hence 'SS swastika'.

this is the symbol of 'mass hysteria',
'cocaine for the masses' [nicotine],
pushing up, mass distraction,
fun time, play time, 
work off, work out, steam off,
sublimation of aggression,
'sanguinic ideal', confident and active,
dogma of heresy, provocation,
confront problems, overrate deviance,
comfort eating, comfort fucking,
adrenal rush/high/arousal, flight and fight response,
blind actionism, active waste of energy,
all are sending, but no one is receiving,
active loneliness.

in the lower octet [classic center],
sleep state = right ZZ swastika
wake  state = left  SS swastika

the 'nazi swastika' or 'mobile swastika'
is tilted by 45 degrees = quarter circle,
opposed to the 'hindu swastika',
with only horizontal and vertical lines.

speculation, probable solution:
the quartets should be split,
either by 'same class' = 'strong bond',
or by 'same tempo' = 'weak bond',
and they should be free
to switch between the two splits
= between the first two bond types
= strong bond vs weak bond.
actors/players and pastors/observers should be split,
and the roles should be switched frequently.



translation to Avicenna of Afshona, weight

weight = mood = warmth [Galen]:
light = sanguinic mood = warm.
heavy = melancholic mood = cold.

Cosmology:
dominance (and mood) scale: fire > air > water > earth.
= dominance over mood
= mood scale with romantic center.



translation to Three Great Planes

P1 = 12. Physical  = fire + earth
P2 =  4. Mental    = water
P3 =  3. Spiritual = air

or swap air and water:

P1 = 12. Physical  = fire + earth
P2 =  3. Mental    = air
P3 =  4. Spiritual = water

= 'the great scale of Life'
= fire < earth < air < water
= class scale with neurotic center.

or:
= fire < earth < water < air
= class scale with melancholic center.

i place fire as the 'oldest element'
cos fire is the 'classic leader'
and 'most hated' in Slave Moral.

Welfare Spending: Soaking the Poor

‘A famous old cartoon shows 
a grand man at the top of a ladder 
which slopes down to a river, 
with less flashy fellows 
on each of the rungs below him.

“Just one more step down,” 
yells the man at the top, 
paying no heed to the man at the bottom, 
whose head is only just out of the water. 

The test of George Osborne’s budget ...’ 

(Editorial, The Guardian, 23 June 2010)

Osborne’s claims of fairness are now exposed as a fraud

‘This isn't the first time in Britain's history 
that politicians with a programme of savage cuts 
have claimed “we're all in this together”. 
An iconic Labour movement cartoon from the early 30s, 
when another coalition came to power 
in the wake of a financial crisis and slump,
shows four class stereotypes of the day on a ladder. 
A cloth capped unemployed man 
is standing at the bottom, up to his neck in water.
“Equality of sacrifice – that's the big idea, friends!”
says the silk-hatted figure at the top.
“Let's all step down one rung.”

Strip away the anachronisms
and that’s exactly the message
George Osborne tried to give in his budget,
as he unveiled
the deepest and fastest cuts in public spending
since the same period.
David Cameron was at it again yesterday,
claiming the budget would "protect the poor".'

(Seumas Milne, The Guardian, 24 June 2010)

noun vs adjective, compound name vs own/eigen/atomic name

--> integrate atoms to groups,
or differentiate to components.

'class' and 'tempo' are useful groups,
cos they corelate with
the first two bonds: strong bond + weak bond.

'gender' and 'age' are the next useful groups,
to describe 'gender congruent' vs 'gender opposing' groups,
and 'romantic center' vs 'classic center' groups.

these groups are 'useful'
cos they are 'real' and not 'imaginary'.

if you want to build more 'obscure' systems,
then you need to use more imaginary groups,
to hide the 'real structure' of atoms.

rational vs personal.

romantics are "rational" and "impersonal" and follow the suggestions of their neurotic sanguinic = element air, to find short-term success = opportunism.
to romantics, one is only a friend, when he supports the current trend and fashion, hence "fascism" or "fashionism" or "select the smart" or "social darwinism".

classics are "irrational" and "personal" [person cults] and follow the suggestions of their psychotic sanguinic = element fire, to find long-term success = opportunism. classic leaders rule over life and death, who can breed, and who must die, by "private reasons" only known to the leaders, not calculated by machine algorithms. publishing such "unwritten laws" is an invitation to sabotage. gentlemen kiss [to life or to death] but never tell [why they choose].

https://thesecretofthetarot.com/numerology-number-16/

The number 16 denotes one who seeks 
wisdom in the attempt to learn enough to both 
teach and help others.

This number 
analyzes the self 
to grasp this wisdom; it has a knack for 
research and it is important to them that they appreciate 
both the spiritual and analytical parts of themselves.

[build and destroy, father and murder, genicos and thanatos]

The number 16 is 
intuitive, 
spiritual, 
wise, and 
self-sufficient in his task to 
learn so he can 
teach others. He is 
both spiritual and practical, 
though he may express himself more as the former.
[cos murder is not 'practical' in the modern public.]

The number 16 is also concerned with being part of a 
harmonious relationship (or multiple relationships). 
However, this does not take away from them being 
able to do for them
selves, and it wouldn’t be surprising if he 
spends a considerable amount of time 
alone (for his own benefit as well as the benefit of others).

The Number 16 in History

The number 16 has been concerned with finding 
wisdom through expanding on the 
self. 

the first Academy Awards ceremony (1929) was held on the 
sixteenth day of July (the seventh month, 16’s core).

Things Associated with the Number 16

In Tarot, the 
Tower card exemplifies great 
change, likely a great change of faith or 
beliefs. It could also be a 
physical change with something like location or 
relationships.

If reversed, the Tower card indicates that change is 
difficult to initiate.

In astrology, 
Neptune vibrates the number 7. Neptune is highly 
intuitive and aims to 
help mankind. In mythology, Poseidon was the 
brother of Zeus who settled for 
reign over the Earth, 
the realm between the heavens and the pit of the Earth.

[strong bond to earth with other sex]

Poseidon is particularly known for 
reigning over the seas and is associated with the 
watery sign of Pisces, the 
last symbol of the zodiac before returning to the 
fiery sign of Aries.

[weak bond to water with same sex]

The 
end of the zodiac wheel is a 
completion of the cycle, 
reaching an understanding of 
wholeness and oneness.



The number 16 
understands others because it understands it
self (or tries to). 
People with 16 popping up in their lives 
(or born on the sixteenth of a month) are in 
tune with the spiritual and the material worlds, 
though they tend to be more 
spiritual from time to time, 
sometimes teeter-tottering on the 
edge of 
delusion.

They have active 
imaginations and enjoy their 
freedom of thought and being. 
It is likely that their 
spirituality will be used to bring 
wisdom to 
family-like 
relationships.

The number 16 denotes one who is 
both emotional and spiritual. 
They are good at setting 
goals (and reaching them), 
and, because they are so 
analytical, they have great skills when it comes to 
researching and getting to the bottom of things.

They are the people who find 
solutions for people 
who don’t know where to look (or where to 
begin).

When the number 16 is around, 
or popping up everywhere, 
it usually indicates something of a spiritual 
awakening. 
In relationships, the number 16 indicates one who is 
romantic without adding too much drama to the pot. 
They enjoy their 
freedom and need it to function properly or they could 
withdraw emotionally.

Negatively speaking, 16s can be very 
demanding of them
selves and, in turn, of 
other people. They want to 
help others 
understand themselves and become spiritually 
aware.

They tend to be very 
anxious, sometimes becoming too 
nervous to 
stay in one job, one place, or one group of people 
for too long. 
They should also keep themselves 
grounded as they sometimes have the inclination to become 
lost in a fantasy world.

Conclusion

The number 16 is a number that represents a 
blending of the spiritual and the material, an 
analyst, 
philosopher, and 
guru. 
For those with the number 16 in their numerology charts 
(particularly the birth day number), 
they can use logic and science to 
analyze and elaborate on their spirituality.

These people should aim to 
use their spiritual knowledge and wisdom to 
help the people in their lives.




translation to Phoenician alphabet

The Phoenician alphabet
is the oldest verified alphabet.

It was used to write Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language,
used by the ancient civilization of Phoenicia
in modern-day Syria, Lebanon, and northern Israel.

The Phoenician alphabet 
is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs.

It became one of the most widely used writing systems, 
spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, 
where it was adopted and modified by many other cultures.

Phoenician was usually written right to left.

Sepher Sapphires
A Treatise On Gematria
by Wade Coleman

https://archive.org/stream/WadeColemanSepherSapphiresATreatiseOnGemBookFi/

Among Hebrew words having the value of 16 are:

Hyssop, signifying purgation or purification;

!TD3 elevated, exalted. High; JCTl, 
She; and like equal to. The Uniting 

Intelligence (Gimel) is the most important means 
of purification. It links personal consciousness to 
the Highest plane of being. It is the wisdom 
personified in Proverbs as a woman. Its full 
exercise enables us to realize the identity of the 
Self in man with universal being. 



the missing link, the four-pronged shin

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_(letter)

The 13th-century Kabbalistic text 
Sefer HaTemunah, 
holds that 
a single letter of unknown pronunciation, 
held by some to be 
the four-pronged shin 
on one side of the teffilin box, 
is missing from the current alphabet. 
The world's flaws, the book teaches, 
are related to the absence of this letter, 
the eventual revelation of which 
will repair the universe. 

repair = re-connect the two halfs, balance,

The trouble is, you think you have time.

what all feel, but none know

know your body


Ectomorphs are thin individuals characterized by 
smaller bone structures and thinner limbs. Think of a typical 
endurance athlete. They tend to be 
thyroid and 
SNS dominant with either a higher output or higher sensitivity to 
catecholamines like epinephrine and norepinephrine. This profile is linked to a 
fast metabolic rate and a 
high carbohydrate tolerance.



Mesomorphs have a 
medium sized bone structure and 
athletic body, and if they’re active, they usually have a considerable amount of lean mass. Many explosive athletes like wrestlers and gymnasts fit these criteria. Mesomorphs tend to be 
testosterone and growth hormone dominant. This profile leads to a predisposition for 
muscle gain and the maintenance of a lower body fat.



Endomorphs have a 
larger bone structure with higher amounts of total body mass and 
fat mass. Football lineman and 
powerlifters are frequently endomorphs. They tend to be naturally 
less active. Where the ectomorphs tend to burn off excess calories with near constant movement, excess calories in endomorphs do not seem to cause that same increase in expenditure. This means that excess calories are more likely to be stored as fat. This profile leads to a greater propensity for 
energy storage, including both lean mass and fat mass. This can also mean a 
lower carbohydrate tolerance.

element = atom

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything

In ancient Greece, pre-Socratic philosophers speculated that the apparent diversity of observed phenomena was due to a single type of interaction, namely the 
motions and collisions of atoms. 
The concept of 'atom', introduced by Democritus, was an early philosophical attempt to unify all phenomena observed in nature.

Archimedes was possibly the first scientist known to have described nature with axioms (or principles) and then deduce new results from them. He thus tried to describe "everything" starting from a few axioms. Any "theory of everything" is similarly expected to be based on axioms and to deduce all observable phenomena from them.[8]:340

Following Democritean atomism, the mechanical philosophy of the 17th century posited that all forces could be ultimately reduced to 
contact forces between the atoms, 
then imagined as tiny solid particles.[9]:184[10]

In the late 17th century, Isaac Newton's description of the long-distance force of gravity implied that not all forces in nature result from things coming into contact. Newton's work in his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy dealt with this in a further example of unification, in this case unifying Galileo's work on terrestrial 
gravity, 
Kepler's laws of planetary motion and the phenomenon of tides by explaining these apparent actions at a distance under one single law: the law of universal gravitation.[11]

In 1814, building on these results, Laplace famously suggested that a sufficiently powerful intellect could, if it knew the position and velocity of every particle at a given time, along with 
the laws of nature, 
calculate the position of any particle at any other time:[12]:ch 7

    An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.
    — Essai philosophique sur les probabilités, Introduction. 1814

Laplace thus envisaged a combination of gravitation and mechanics as a theory of everything. Modern quantum mechanics implies that 
uncertainty is inescapable, 
and thus that Laplace's vision has to be amended: a theory of everything must include gravitation and quantum mechanics.

In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered a connection between electricity and magnetism, triggering decades of work that culminated in 1865, in James Clerk 
Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. 
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it gradually became apparent that many common examples of 
forces 
– contact forces, elasticity, viscosity, friction, and pressure – result from 
electrical interactions between the smallest particles of matter.

In his experiments of 1849–50, Michael Faraday was the first to search for a unification of gravity with electricity and magnetism.[13] However, he found no connection.

In 1900, David Hilbert published a famous list of mathematical problems. In Hilbert's sixth problem, he challenged researchers to find an axiomatic basis to all of physics. In this problem he thus asked for what today would be called a theory of everything.[14]

In the late 1920s, the new quantum mechanics showed that the chemical bonds between atoms were examples of (quantum) electrical forces, justifying Dirac's boast that "the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known".[15]

After 1915, when Albert Einstein published the theory of gravity (general relativity), the search for a unified field theory combining gravity with electromagnetism began with a renewed interest. In Einstein's day, the strong and the weak forces had not yet been discovered, yet, he found the potential existence of two other distinct forces -gravity and electromagnetism- far more alluring. This launched his thirty-year voyage in search of the so-called "unified field theory" that he hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. During these last few decades of his life, this quixotic quest isolated Einstein from the mainstream of physics. Understandably, the mainstream was instead far more excited about the newly emerging framework of quantum mechanics. Einstein wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, "I have become a lonely old chap who is mainly known because he doesn't wear socks and who is exhibited as a curiosity on special occasions." Prominent contributors were Gunnar Nordström, Hermann Weyl, Arthur Eddington, David Hilbert,[16] Theodor Kaluza, Oskar Klein (see Kaluza–Klein theory), and most notably, Albert Einstein and his collaborators. Einstein intensely searched for, but ultimately failed to find, a unifying theory.[17]:ch 17 (But see:Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.) More than a half a century later, Einstein's dream of discovering a unified theory has become the Holy Grail of modern physics. 




In 1900, David Hilbert published a famous list of mathematical problems. In Hilbert's sixth problem, he challenged researchers to find an axiomatic basis to all of physics. In this problem he thus asked for what today would be called a theory of everything.[14]

Thumb Angle Of Opposition

stigma for tempo

test:
press hand to a flat surface,
keep other fingers together,
keep all fingers straight,
spread off thumb.

14. psychotic = large angle = 90 degrees
23. neurotic  = small angle = 60 degrees

Wide Angle: Industriousness, self-reliance, capability to get results, initiative, determination, likes a large territory to master, can see big vision
how aggressively, directly, and intentionally a person does things to get results in life
how successful a person is in achieving goals
how ready a person is to go to work and get the job done
The larger the angle, the stronger the desire to make things happen and get positive results in life. The bigger the angle that you hold your thumb out to the side, the more aggressively you tackle doing things for success.
You are a very reliable person and you love to work. Moreover, you like to finish everything you start.
open
flexible
detached
big steps
seek change = strong bond to neurotic
functional


Narrow Angle: Desire less responsibility, possibly introverted, more inward focus, can be overwhelmed by obstacles, may hitch yourself to someone else’s wagon to go along for the ride without focus on what you want, or may be able to surrender to circumstances beyond your control (where wide-angle thumb person might fight the situation).
 very shy and they dislike new things and big changes. Hence, they have their comfort zone and they will never step out of it.
shy
seek stability = strong bond to psychotic

Your big thumb angle (C) reveals that you are strongly independent, resourceful, and someone who is ready to take action and make big things happen! If others aren’t fast enough, you will do what needs to be done before the others can get organized enough to get started. That is what a big thumb angle indicates: excellent natural resources and skills for achieving great successes in all areas. Lucky you!

Your large thumb angle is one of the best palmistry indicators for success. This large thumb angle indicates that you know at your deepest subconscious level that you have extraordinary energy to make big things happen in your own desired way. You easily change the physical world to get results where others fail. You are always ready to take on challenges to make big things happen and get the rewarding results in unique ways others fear to try.

With a big thumb angle, you naturally and easily apply your keen skills and talents wisely to give you an edge over your competition so that you get closer to money, power, and success before they do. Your advantages (indicated by this big thumb angle), plus hard work and a little luck, will put you closer to your desired money and success far beyond your expectations.





A small thumb angle (A) reveals a cautious person who is often involved in mental activities of personal importance (like daydreaming). This person does not have a high priority in making many physical things happen in their outer physical world. Instead of taking action to accomplish physical things, she or he would rather be a loyal and trusted follower, letting others do the job and take the credit. Only when this person with a small thumb angle feels safe and very supported does she, or he take independent action to produce significant results in the outer physical world. This person is a “dreamer” rather than a “doer”.

For those people who are in continuous bliss and/or who don’t want any changes in life, then a small thumb angle is perfect for them. There are certainly times when it is not important to “push the river”.

12. meso = muscular, balanced, straight fingers
4. ecto = boney, light, long bones, broad / wide, long narrow palms, long index finger, short ring finger
34. extra = conical fingers, pointy fingers

translation to John T. Manning, 2D:4D digit ratio

2D = index finger
4D = ring finger

index finger length, 
relative to ring finger length,
with middle finger as symmetry center.

4.  long: water, prenatal estrogen exposure [PNEE], more feminine
12. medium: classics
3.  short: air, prenatal androgen exposure [PNAE], more masculine, in males: more prostate cancer

androgen exposure "at the time of brain organization" --> confidence, risk seeking, search persistence [pushy, greed for profit / reward], alert, awake, quick response, more verbal aggression [tourette], impatient, right brain, better in spacial / numerical / musical abilities

https://fingerlengthdigitratio.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/new-report-confirms-finger-length-linked-with-verbal-aggression/

https://fingerlengthdigitratio.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/low-2d4d-values-are-associated-with-video-game-addiction/




why is air still a feminine element?

... even if air has overall higher androgen levels, after prenatal androgen exposure [PNAE].

an air body has a higher "androgen baseline" [noise floor],
so when the genital area makes estrogen, the difference to the baseline is higher than the difference from "body androgen" to "genital androgen". [assuming that androgen and estrogen have opposite effects.] 

in a female air body, 
the genitals are more different than the rest of the body. 

in a male air body, 
the genitals are more similar than the rest of the body.

more different = better expressed, stronger

m3. male air: facial symmetry
[ female air: genital symmetry ? ]

m4. male water: academic success
4. water: verbal skills, more agreeable [melancholic

f4. high facial symmetry, more fertile

Many are called, but few chosen (Matthew 20:16)

144000 chosen ones? let me translate.

1. 144 of 1000 = 14.4 percent.
2. chosen for survival, all others will die in war.
3. 144 = 12 * 12 ----> 3 * 3
4. 72 males + 72 females, hence the "72 virgins" in islam culture.

5. georgia guide stones, command 1: keep world population below 500 million. 500M / 0.144 = 3.47G = world population in year 1968. the GGS were published in year 1980 at N=4.36G
6. 144 = 1000 / 7, rounded up to the next even number.
7. described in Revelation 7 #seven
8. 144 = 16 * 9 = 16 * 3 * 3 .... nice .... sixteen = ayin = perfection = wholeness = letter G

1a. yes, thats a relative number. relative to the whole population.
1b. 144 of 1000 = 72 of 500 = 36 of 250 = 18 of 125 = 90 of 625.
1c. 144 + 856 = 1000

3a. also Revelation 7 calls them the "virgins" .... as in perfect genetics, breeding champions, free of genetic disease

6a. 144 = 1/7 of 1008 .... 144 * 7 = 1008
6b. 144 + 864 = 1008

#numerology ----> God speaks through Numbers, sacred geometry

the only question left to me: why dont we have war more often? why dont we select more often? like every 16 years. 

cos with longer cycles, you increase "selection pressure" for all? as motivation to work? sounds stupid to me, not perfect at all.

maybe our princes are so obsessed with their "holy scripts" that they are too smart to build better systems from scratch?

psychotic = crusader + sensor
https://health.ph360.me/ph360/how-to-communicate-with-each-health-type-sensors-crusaders/



fire = Crusader

Crusaders are driven to 
achieve and frequently 
succeed, especially when goals require a high level of mental and physical 
work. They are 
self-determined without the need for constant praise and feedback, are willing to take 
risks and make 
large efforts to create their ideas, and may 
sacrifice a lot to achieve what they believe they 
must.

The Crusader enjoys a 
challenge, does well with 
routine, is 
dependable, 
responsible, and perceived as 
intelligent. They prefer 
predictability, 
reliability and willingly accept responsibility.

Crusaders enjoy insatiable 
curiosity which feeds their drive for 
learning and they tend to seek out lots of 
detail and thrive when learning and creating. They are 
competitive and 
ambitious and strive for 
accuracy in order to be 
authoritative and 
correct in their positions.

Crusaders need to pay attention to the health of their nervous system. Getting plenty of 
B vitamins, 
minerals from well-cooked foods, and 
essential fatty acids can go a long way in keeping their body and mind healthy.



earth = Diplomat

The Diplomat is 
durable, 
reliable, 
safe, 
methodic, 
steady, 
balanced and 
enduring.

Diplomats are 
visual learners and may be good at recognizing behavior patterns (i.e., in people, in diseases, and in nature). They can follow and 
decipher charts, patterns, and systems and are gifted with the ability of 
discovering solutions to complex problems.

By nature, Diplomats are dependable, 
easy-going, and enjoy pleasurable experiences. They do well with a 
predictable, patterned 
routine and when 
motivated by a fierce desire their focus and discipline allow them to achieve their goal. Diplomats enjoy 
learning, and will 
obey the rules, unless the rules prevent them from enjoyment. They make 
dependable employees, are 
easy to get along with and, with their sense of 
fairness, work well in 
mediating conflict.

Diplomats need to pay attention to the health of their 
circulatory system and their 
intestinal tract. By 
reducing toxic buildup from food and the environment and maintaining a healthy lifestyle that 
keeps things moving within the body, they’ll naturally promote their endurance and longevity.



air = Connector

Connectors naturally consider the needs of others, are 
open and 
friendly, 
helpful, available, forgiving, kind, and 
affectionate. Connectors enjoy connecting with others. Due to their natural body makeup, 
talking to others is very good for them. Success in health will come more easily if they have support from a coach or loved ones and they can share their experience with people.

A Connector is a good 
teammate, able to 
share ideas, frequently thinks out 
loud, and can often manage 
multiple tasks throughout the day, although not necessarily all at the same time.

The Connector tends to feel things very 
physically and enjoys 
touch, hugs, good 
food, and physical pleasures. When they choose to, they can be a fabulous 
leader of fun activities and very 
persuasive and influential.

Connectors need to pay attention to the health of their 
cardiovascular system. Simple dietary changes like the inclusion of 
green leafy vegetables and 
allium vegetables together with mixed 
aerobic and 
resistance training can go a long way in keeping them healthy. 




water = Sensor

The Sensor is 
analytically organized, 
consistent, 
loyal, 
orderly, 
intellectual, 
sensitive, 
focused, 
determined, 
motivated, 
ambitious, 
strong minded, 
meticulous, 
detail oriented and 
creative.

Sensors have the ability to 
read others, perceive and interact at an intellectual level and can be mentally (and even physically!) 
flexible, 
incorporating many ideas into 
complex concepts or theories.

Given the space and tools necessary, Sensors can easily accomplish a significant degree of mental work. They enjoy 
learning and details, and are good at 
creating systems, strategies, and 
directing work flow. The Sensor is 
disciplined and 
consistent and a 
fast learner.

Sensors need to pay attention to their mental well being by 
avoiding chronic stress. Adapting a lifestyle that helps 
manage stress will go a long way in maintaining a healthy body and mind, while preventing stress-related issues.

----> the eight constitutions




Dowon Kuon, Eight-Constitution Medicine

Eight different types of human individuality exist as eight constitutions, which are not solely mental or physical but encompass all traits.

The eight different dynamic orders physically and mentally form eight distinct individualities, which hence are the eight constitutions: Hepatonia, Cholecystonia, Pancreotonia, Gastrotonia, Pulmotonia, Colonotonia, Renotonia and Vesicotonia.

vagotonia

strong parasympathetic nervous system [PNS+]

natural endurance, mostly relaxed / lazy / patient

Wood + Earth
= classics = mesomorph

tendency to ....
low blood pressure (hypotension, depression), 
low heart rate (bradycardia), 
miosis (excessive constriction of the pupil), 
often cold hands and feet, 
cold sweat (dry humor of air and water), 
severe fatigue, and sometimes 
vasovagal syncope (loss of consciousness). 

feed and breed
rest and digest

The parasympathetic nervous system is dominant in situations of 
rest and relaxation, it has an activating effect on 
digestive organs and a relieving one on the heart. 
Endurance training supports vagotonia. For example, a 
low heart rate may be observed with sportsmen. With trained people vagotonia isn't regarded as abnormal, but rather as beneficial and 
protective in effect. [long life]

Vasovagal syncope is typically triggered by seeing blood, pain, emotional stress, or prolonged standing. lightheadedness, nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), ringing in the ears, an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak or form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost). Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing. 

Typical triggers include:
Prolonged standing
Emotional stress
Pain
The sight of blood
Time varying magnetic field (i.e. transcranial magnetic stimulation) --> EMF, electrosmog, energy weapons

tense/strong Striated muscles = Skeletal muscles, heart muscles --> athletic body shape = mesomorph

voluntary muscle contractions, strong physical self-control [but poor mental self-control]





sympathicotonia

strong sympathetic nervous system [SNS+]

mostly tense / greedy / active

sympathicotonia
Metal + Water
= romantics = extramorphs


excessive tone of the sympathetic nervous system with unusually 
high blood pressure, 
fine tremor of the hands, and 
insomnia = short sleep = rise early; 
may be present in thyrotoxic patients.

fight or flight

dilated pupils
weak genitals = shorter swelling of genitals
sweating [warm sweat?] (moist humor of air and water)
fast pulse = high heart rate (tachycardia)
slow digestion = inhibited peristalsis
excess catecholamines secretion = dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline
higher demand for tyrosine / phenylalanine
[
	avoid long-acting stimulants (guarana, amphetamine, mescaline)
	prefer short-acting stimulants (coffeine)
	[after burnout and catecholamine-depletion, 
	they might compensate with long-acting stimulant drugs]
]

Sympathicotonia is a stimulated condition of the sympathetic nervous system, marked by vascular spasm [close arteries, tense vascular smooth muscles], elevated blood pressure, and goose bumps.

tense/strong Smooth muscles = walls of hollow organs = arteries, veins, stomach, intestines, urinary bladder, uterus, respiratory tracts, urinary tracts [urine constipation?], reproductive systems

Smooth muscles: mostly single-unit variety = either the whole muscle contracts or the whole muscle relaxes

smooth muscle tissue tends to demonstrate greater 
elasticity and function within a larger length-tension curve than striated muscle
ability to stretch and still maintain contractility

Phasic or tonic

Smooth muscle may contract 
phasically with rapid contraction and relaxation, or 
tonically with slow and sustained contraction. 

tonic muscle type: reproductive, digestive, respiratory, and urinary tracts, skin, eye, and vasculature. 
This type of smooth muscle can 
maintain force for prolonged time with only little energy utilization.








colored taping method.

to what color does one type "respond"?
[respond = relax, balance]
negative colors: white, red
positive colors: black, blue

this should also apply for
underwear color
bed sheets color
= colors that touch the naked skin

= "other color" not "eigen color"

for each of the constitutions, there is a basic prescription that is preferred for all treatments. This was the link connecting these two constitutions that responded to the colors.

blue, the liver color.
Hepatonia = strong liver --> suppress liver = Is
Pulmotonia = weak liver --> stimulate liver = Ip

white, the lung color.
Cholecystonia = weak lungs --> stimulate lungs = VIIp
Colonotonia = strong lungs --> suppress lungs = VIIs

black, the kidney color.
Renotonia = strong kidney --> suppress kidney = IXs
Pancreotonia = weak kidney --> stimulate kidney = IXp

red, the pancreas color.
Vesicotonia = weak pancreas --> stimulate pancreas = Vp
Gastrotonia = strong pancreas --> suppress pancreas = Vs

[exchange Vp and Vs? p = stimulate = push, s = suppress]



1+ = Blue  Tape [fire?  M1?] [Heart]
1- = White Tape [fire?  F1?] [Small Intestine]

2+ = Black Tape [earth? M2?] [Pancreas/Spleen]
2- = Red   Tape [earth? F2?] [Stomach]

3+ = Blue  Tape [air?   M3?] [Lung]
3- = White Tape [air?   F3?] [Large Intestine]

4+ = Black Tape [water? M4?] [Kidney, Liver]
4- = Red   Tape [water? F4?] [Bladder, GallBladder]

melancholics: black or red
sanguinics:   white or blue

[
	blue = 1+ or 3+ --> boys?
	red  = 2- or 4- --> girls?
]


blue tape 
affixed to the Hepatonia patients, who have strong livers, 
absorbed the strength of the liver and thus suppressed it, 
while the 
blue tape used with Pulmotonia patients supplemented the strength of the liver and thus stimulated it

five organs and five elements, zang-fu and wu-xing

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zang-fu

The zang-fu are also connected to the twelve standard meridians.
each yang meridian is attached to a fu   organ and 
each yin  meridian is attached to a zang organ.

Fire (火) = Heart (心) and Small Intestine (小肠) (and, secondarily, Sānjiaō [三焦, ‘’Triple Burner‘’] and Pericardium [心包])
Earth (土) = Spleen (脾) and Stomach (胃)
Metal (金) = Lung (肺)and Large Intestine (大肠)
Water (水) = Kidney (肾) and Bladder (膀胱)
Wood (木) = Liver (肝) and Gall Bladder (胆)

The zàng organs' essential functions consist in manufacturing and storing qì and blood (and, in the case of the Kidney, essence). The fǔ organs' main purpose is to transmit and digest (传化, pinyin: chuán-huà) substances (like waste, food, etc.).[6]

Hepatonia = high blood pressure

Cholecystonia = extreme alcohol addict

Pulmotonia = Atopic dermititis --> avoid meat

are constitutions hereditary or acquired?

Without doubt, they are hereditary. 
There is a gene that is modeled after the constitution of one of the two parents. 

There may be some Christians who would counter that the concept of inherited constitution is not scriptural. 

Their basic for such as argument would be that if constitution was hereditary, that there would have to have been essentially several Adams created, one for each constitution. 

Of course the first people, Adam and Eve, were of the same constitution. We see that the foods they were 
instructed to eat are similar to those that 
an herbivorous animal would eat : grins, vegetables, 
and fruits, proving the sameness of their constitutions.

Adam and Eve, being of the same constitution, 
were of a unity and peace that would not allow for any deviation between the two of them. Yet the fact that their unity was one of non-divergence was true even when they found themselves being deceived not by their Creator, but by the Evil Tempter. In a like manner, even their descendants afterwards were of unity and consistency in their evil, with their large-scale crimes leading them to encounter the great wrath of their Creator so that the entire human race, with the exception of the 
eight-member family of the righteous man Noah, were completely as punishment in the Great Flood as the whole earth was filled with water for around one year.

What would then have been a way to prevent the reoccurrence of the same large-scale crimes of humanity that had brought about the punishment of the Great Flood ? It was none other than by 
preventing total unity among humans 
by dividing and splitting their opinions, leading to diversity. In other words, what we see after the Great Flood was a re-creation of the human race in which mankind, which had been of 
one constitution, was now split into 
eight constitutions. 
The Creator had called Noah's 
family of eight, who would become the progenitors of the post-Great-Flood human race, 

and told them, "Every moving thing that lives (things in the past that could not be eaten) shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs." I believe, as such, that the power of re-creation began to take place as the constitutions of those people who followed that command changed as they went about eating new foods. Thus the 
eight members of Noah's family became of 
eight constitutions, and the entire human race has inherited these genes. 




healthy imbalance, appropriate imbalance

there are individual differences between people physically, just as there are emotionally. There is a distinction between seeing such differences as a cause for disease and instead seeing them as a healthy, appropriate imbalance. 



I have been using the term "constitution" in English as the equivalent for the Korean term chejil. However, there are many other suitable terms that could also be used, such as temperament, status, habits, diathesis, and predispositio

index finger = distal pulse
middle finger = medial pulse
ring finger = proximal pulse

pulse animals
Vata pulse  = cobra pulse
Pitta pulse = frog  pulse
Kapha pulse = swan  pulse

Vata Pitta Kapha pulse

Vata pulse  is  superficial,  cold,  light,  thin,  feeble  and
empty. With more pressure, it disappears. It moves fast and
may become irregular. It is best felt under the index finger.
With keen observation one can feel  a  little leech or a little
cobra  moving  under  the  finger.  Try  to  have  that  insight
when  feeling  the  pulse. 
Vata pulse  is  cold  to  the  touch
because  of  insufficient  insulating  material  and  very  little
subcutaneous fat, which is why people with a 
vata constitu­tion lose heat and hate cold.

Pitta pulse  is  full  with  a  strong  throb.  It  is  hot  and
abrupt, with high amplitude, good volume and considerable
force. It is best felt under the middle finger and it moves like
a leaping frog. 
Pitta pulse  is hot to  the touch because 
pitta people have strong heat.

Kapha pulse is deep, slow, watery, wavy and cool to the touch. 
It moves like a swimming swan. 
Kapha people retain heat in the body because of the thick layer of fat under the skin. 

The temperature of the pulse, as mentioned in this sec­tion, denotes much more than just the feeling of warmth or cold felt on the skin. To  the sensitive  clinician,  there is  an intuitive  feeling of temperature reflected  through the pulse itself.

speculation:
4. extreme distal = water = Vata = index finger
1. moderate distal = fire = Pitta-Vata = middle and index finger
2. moderate proximal = earth = Pitta-Kapha = middle and ring finger
3. extreme proximal = air = Kapha = ring finger




https://www.asanajournal.com/science-nadi-nadi-pariksha/

water: fluid / diluted / thin blood
The most subtle dosha is vata, which is light, mobile, subtle and expansive. With very little pressure, the blood flow can be blocked. Even if vata is partially blocked by the finger, its subtlety will not create a spike at the proximal curvature of each palpating finger. It will easily go through to find space to expand and create a spike at the distal curvature of the fingers, as shown in the picture.

classics:
Like vata, pitta is also light, but it is liquid, oily and substantial in nature, whereas vata is dry and empty. Because of its light and liquid qualities, a pitta spike will be felt at the middle curvature of each of the three fingers.

air: viscous / concentrated / saturated / thick blood.
"blood is thicker than water"
Kapha is heavy, oily, static and slow, so it stops at the site on the finger closest to the heart and creates a spike at the proximal curvature of each finger.

differential pulse monitoring.

https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-PTT-estimation-using-simultaneous-noninvasive-measurements-of-pressure-waveform-in_fig6_274262542

the noninvasive brachial and radial pressure
waveforms were acquired by two circular piezoelectric tranducers placed over the left arm and held in place by two straps around the brachial and radial sites, respectively. To reduce the error caused by analog-to-digital converter quantization (i.e., to maintain high signal resolution), the 4-channel, 24-bit resolution NI USB-9239 data acquisition board (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) was used for pulse data acquisition. The continuous Finapres BP machine (Finapres Medical Systems B.V., The Netherlands) was employed to simultaneously measure the beat-to-beat BP waveforms by an inflating cuff dynamically fitting around the middle finger at the right hand. To ensure synchronization of the pulse waveforms acquired by the USB-9239 module and the continuous BP waveforms detected by the Finapres device, both of them were recorded in the same computer.

Eight-Constitution Medicine is a type of immunotherapy and approaches to treat the cause of an illness through restoring the weakened or dissipating immune system by changing the overly-unbalanced state of organs into a suitably-unbalanced state. Eight-Constitution Medicine also encourages patients to follow constitutional regimens, depending on his or her constitution, in order to prevent and treat illnesses. For example, patients should consume foods that would stimulate rather than suppress weak organs; they should also consume foods that would suppress rather than stimulate strong organs. Over time, such dieting will convert the body from an overly-unbalanced state of organs to a suitably-unbalanced state.


The constitution of an individual can be identified by taking the pulses on the radial artery of both wrists. This method, which differs from traditional pulse-taking in oriental medicine, finds a pulse formation among eight different pulse formations, each associated with a particular constitution. The eight pulse formations are inborn and inalterable.

Ostwald’s colour space
Ostwald theorised that
order  leads  to  harmony
and derived a colour space based on
opponent colours and the pre-existing idea that any colour could be visualised as the
pure hue mixed with proportions of black and white.  His work (Ostwald, 1969), was
later adopted as the basis of the Swedish NCS system (Scandinavian Colour Institute,
2009):
“NCS – Natural Color System
R
©
c
©
is a logical colour notation system which
builds on how the human being sees colour.  A notation represents a specific
colour percept and describes the colour visually, it is not depending
[sic]
on
limitations  caused  by  pigments,  light  rays  or  nerve  signals  that  have  given
rise to this perception.”
23
The specification of colour using NCS is easier to explain than spectral, RGB, or three
dimensional hue/saturation/lightness representations. It has two pairs of opponent hues
(red/green and blue/yellow) and a vertical lightness axis in a double cone arrangement.
Forty hues are defined (fig.  2.20
24
), arranged around the centre of the two cones.  The
internal colours are defined as mixtures by adding varying ratios of black and white
(fig.  2.21), a property that has an attractive conceptual simplicity.  The NCS system is
perceptually-based, but not perceptually uniform (Kuehni, 2003).  The NCS is widely
used and while it is possible to derive harmonious colour combinations from paths in
the colour space (H ̊ard and Sivik, 2001), its definition in terms of colour samples and
its lack of perceptually uniformity (Kuehni, 2003) limits its usefulness in the automatic
design of colour schemes.

Unique hues
Among the perceived colours, some are felt to be more fundamental than others. These are, so to say, psychological primaries, or unique hues. Generally, red, yellow and blue are named as fundamental sensations, in most cases also green. Different people agree remarkably well in their selection of unique yellow. Unique red, green, and blue shows some more variation.
While unique red may be considered to be the colour closest to the L-cone primary, unique green accordingly closest to the M-cone primary, unique blue is different from the S-cone primary which is blue-violet. And there is no cone-primary corresponding to yellow.
        	Figure 36: The unique hues (unique green cannot be rendered well on the screen).
   	Figure 37: Black and white are unique sensations too.

That there are unique hues which are not corresponding to the cone primaries is evidence for the fact that colour vision is not a simple one-step process. The optical data get transformed before they are perceived consciously.

this is our god:
natural order.

this is a "lost eye",
banned from paradise,
trapped in made order,
rationalizing with:
"i dont need your god".

the good news is:
"but our god needs you."

the bad news is:
"you will loose your name,
and become a number:
one, two, three, or four."

mir ist wieder eingefallen, wer "der sechser" ist.

6 = 5 + 1 = der einser der anderen hälfte = M1 = feuer mann,
wenn man 1 bis 4 zum matriarchat rechnet [kollektivismus, hochkultur].

im "vier elemente system" ist 5 die zweite null / der zweite daumen.
1 = feuer, 2 = erde, 3 = luft, 4 = wasser.

matriarchat = F1 M2 M3 F4 = 1 2 3 4 = psychotiker sind frauen = gender opposing types = kollektivisten,

patriarchat = M1 F2 F3 M4 = 6 7 8 9 = psychotiker sind männer = gender congruent types = individualisten.

jesus wär dann z.b. ein neuner.
oder mutter teresa wär ne sieben.
cindy von marzahn wär ne acht : D
und frauentausch andreas wär ein sechser.

zuman is auchn neuner.
sacha baron cohen is auchn neuner. 
[gegenfarbe gelb --> gelber anzug von ali G, ali = 4, G = 16 ....]

ich bin ein sechser.
warum ist der sechser so böse?
weil er "über leben und tod" richten will.
= serienvater und serienmörder
weil er ein "klassischer gott" sein will, aber nicht sein darf.
--> serienmord vs massenmord, kleinkrieg vs weltkrieg

das mit "null gleich fünf" sieht man auch in den ziffern.
6 = 1 o = einser mit kringel.

der teufel mann ist rot [zunge, eichel],
der christus mann ist blau [fernsinn = augen + ohren]
= feuer und wasser, M1 und M4,
eigentlich "best friends" im naturrecht = als kleinkinder,
nur durch falsche erziehung immer wieder getrennt.

blöd nur,
dass "sie" die perfekte abwehr haben,

egal wie gut die vorsätze der eltern sind.







A bindi (from Sanskrit binduu, meaning "point, drop, dot or small particle") is a coloured dot worn on the centre of the forehead, originally by Hindus and Jains.

In Hinduism, the color red represents honor, love, and prosperity

Traditionally they are green in colour with red dot in the middle.

from Greek γράμμα (grámma), "letter"—had adopted a specialised meaning in Late Antiquity of "one twenty-fourth part of an ounce" (two oboli),[7] corresponding to about 1.14 modern grams. This use of the term is found in the carmen de ponderibus et mensuris ("poem about weights and measures") composed around 400 AD

British: 16 ounces = 1 pound.

Greek: 24 grams = 1 ounce

Late Antiquity: 
1 old gram = 1.14 new grams
1 new gram = 0.88 old grams

1 gram (g) = 15.4323583529 grains (gr) = 4 x 4

1 avoirdupois ounce (oz) = 28.349523125 grams (g) = 4 x 7

1 lb 	(pound) 	= 453.59 g

1 troy ounce (ozt) = 31.1034768 grams (g) = 4 x 8

500 grams (g) = 1 Jin in the Chinese units of measurement.





hide and seek.
how to find god with sixteen types.

world peace has failed,
and will always fail.

what nature wants,
is a rapid change
between "war" and "peace",
between hide and seek.

what "nature" wants?
what small kids want!

kids need other kids,
of the same age,
to "play together"
as one generation.

play together?
group dynamics!
hide and seek.

just what do they seek?
and where do they hide?
the answer is simple and effective:
sixteen types.

Bunter Turmalin gilt als Rundum-Heilstein, der sich sehr positiv auf alle körperlichen und seelischen Heilungsprozesse einstellt. 

Die Kraft der Steine richtet sich nach Farben und Transparenz, so dass man die dunklen Steine mehr für den unteren Bereich des Körpers einordnet, orange für den Beckenbereich, gelb für den Magenbereich und den Solar-Plexus, grün für den Bereich des Brustkorbs, blau für den Halsbereich, während violett bis weiß den Kopfbereich einbezieht. 

Die zweite Unterscheidung liegt darin, wie kräftig oder transparent ein Stein gefärbt ist, denn je zarter und durchsichtiger er ist, desto feiner sind die Wirkungen und die Ebenen, auf die er einwirkt: kraftvolle Farben = Körper, zarte Farben = Psyche, transparent- durchscheinend = tiefe Schichten der Seele (gut bei Traumaerkrankungen).

"too big to fail" versus "live only in private" [epikur]
large groups have no need to hide.
their size makes them resistant.
majority vote.
see: scientology, with highly organized defense routines.
only small groups [sects] must hide.
= lower middle class.
--> large group vs small group, corporation vs farm, state vs family
--> per aspera ad astra, through "crime" to wealth

problem:
how to encode gender?

left  vs     right
matriarchy   patriarchy
F1 <-- 1 --> M1
M2 <-- 2 --> F2
M3 <-- 3 --> F3
F4 <-- 4 --> M4

0 = 5, patriarchy first:
M1 = 1 vs 6 = F1?
F2 = 2 vs 7 = M2?
F3 = 3 vs 8 = M3?
M4 = 4 vs 9 = F4?

o = female gender
i = male gender



hide + seek
what is hidden / sought
who are victims / bait / treasure
kids
girls, virgins
rich, health, beauty, fame, stars
"kinder und frauen zu erst"
women and children first

who is sacrificed
old
men
sick, poor, lone


words
direct


why hide order?
cos they can?
cos perfection is boring?
as bait / attractor / mystery?
cos neurotics will never "understand"?

die wiedertäufer des systems sind die lehrer, die talent selektieren sollen. blöd nur: sie kommen viel zu spät. talent sieht man schon bei kleinkindern, an hand vom körpertyp und vom verhalten zu anderen körpertypen. je früher man "naturordnung" herstellt und die richtigen freunde vermittelt, desto besser für das kind. je später, desto besser für die "falschen erwartungen" der dummen alten, der gerontokratie, der ganz normalen kinderficker. naturordnung braucht keine worte und keinen zwang. wenn ein system mit kleinkindern versagt, dann wird es immer versagen. und "geborenen königen" [element feuer] das [serien-, ritual-] morden verbieten ist nochmal ein ganz eigenes problem, das die grundlage bereitet für wucher, spekulationsblasen, krisen und kriege.




fick die kirche.
aber dies mal richtig.

alles ist die sekte.
The Cult is All.

falsche lehrer.
falsche propheten.
ketzer.
öffentliche lästerer.

ketzer werden im FEUER verbrannt.

wer richten will, der wird gerichtet.
naturfeuer gegen kunstfeuer.
naturrecht gegen anmaßung.

todesstrafe gegen prediger ohne lizenz der kirche.

böse geister austreiben.
liebe zum selbst und zu den nächsten.

pazifismus ist nur scheinheiliger mantel der verführer.

T = 25:00

jagd auf andersgläubige = konkurrenz.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ws-VOHXOrQ&index=4&list=PLOWIDYw1pknkOPTPYoA8x6EovEEvXeklx

28:40

luther fordert strafe gegen jesus-jünger:
29:00
jesus liebt jünger,
jünger liebt jünger.

luther: sünde und ablass
sünde muss sein, ablass als reparation
pseudo-problem und pseudo-lösung

rape logic
null toleranz bei widerspruch
schädliche lehrer des verderbens
--> schuld an verfall, dekadenz, endzeit

luther:
opportunist, romantiker
abwechselnd besessen von gott und teufel

luther = M3.

zorn
hass

"pazifismus"? freier wille!
keine erziehung mit zwang, auch nicht "weicher zwang".

T = 00:00

--> regio, lokal
"kommunisten"
gütergemeinschaft

T = 4:00

befreite sind weniger manipulierbar und regierbar
--> politische verfolgung
--> slave catcher auf jagd nach entlaufenen sklaven




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNB_C0ZC3_8&list=PLOWIDYw1pknkOPTPYoA8x6EovEEvXeklx&index=3

same here. ich darf nur "begleiteten umgang" mit meinem kind haben, und das jugendamt darf bestimmen, wer als "umgangs begleiter" wirken darf. von 720 stunden im monat darf ich mein kind eine stunde "sehen", und dann in totaler isolation, wo das kind alleine spielen soll. selbst ein gefangener in der JVA darf mehr besuch empfangen. die mutter wird genötigt, das kind alleine zu erziehen. --> sabotage, sippenhaft, erpressung, weisse folter. warum? weil ich die falsche "politische gesinnung" habe, extrem rechts, element feuer, extravertierter psychotiker, böser nazi / jude / kommunist / ketzer / aufstandsführer .... blöd dass mein körpertyp [herz-mesomorph] diese "gesinnung" diktiert, und dass keiner eine "freie wahl" über seinen körpertyp hat. klar, ich kann luft spielen, oder wasser spielen, aber genau das ist ja das problem, und eben nicht die lösung. physis über pathos. körper über geist.﻿



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ws-VOHXOrQ&list=PLOWIDYw1pknkOPTPYoA8x6EovEEvXeklx&index=4

7:15 und 33:30 "unser gott befiehlt, seine feinde mit rufmord zu tode zu hetzen" [treibjagd, zu tode foltern] .... "ich bin nur ein diener gottes", "ich richte über engel" --> scheinheilig, faule ausrede, unverantwortlich, nie schuld, perfekte abwehr. naturfeuer und kunstfeuer. politische verfolgung gegen "geborene könige" = element feuer = extravertierter psychotiker = eigenfarbe rot = konkurrent für alte herren.﻿

26:46 luther würde "man" heute einsperren, als volksverhetzer [hassrede gegen "juden" und "wiedertäufer" und "bauernkrieger"] oder als geisteskranker mit "gewaltphantasien" und "zwanghaft besessen"-er störung, induziert durch alkohol-vergiftung. [wein ist die kalte waffe der römer gegen die eingeborenen germanen, kelten, gallier]



luther's feindbild
wucherer
geizhälse
juden --> psychotiker, vor allem element feuer

luther = augustiner-mönch

4:40 alle teufel sind in die bauern gefahren

12:22 juden-tempel mit feuer verbrennen, mit erde begraben. feuer + erde = klassiker = mesomorph = verteidiger
12:40 damit gott sehe, dass wir christen sind. --> suche nach absolution durch "sinnlose rituale" und "blinden aktionismus".
13:09 juden sollen daheim bleiben --> hausarrest, verbannung aus öffentlichkeit enteignung, zwangsarbeit ....
14:28 mordaufruf gegen türken: faust heben, schlagen, morden ....
18:35 mordaufruf gegen zauberer --> INRI = justum (est) necare reges impios = es ist gerecht zu morden könige ohne pietät.
4:40 alle teufel sind in die bauern gefahren --> bauernaufstände
4:54 wir leben in wunderlichen zeiten, wo beten weniger hilft als morden, um in den himmel zu kommen. stirbst du im kampf, gut für dich. einen besseren tod gibt es nicht, denn du stirbst in gehorsam zu unserem gott.﻿

Denk|Reise|Extra - Die Apokalypse von Münster 1

laaaaaaaangweilig.
deine "schlauen bücher" vermitteln ein falsches bild von "wiedertaufe".
für mich: wiedertaufe meint die korrektur eines falschen selbstbild [nomen est omen],
das von unfähigen eltern und lehrern [falschen propheten] aufgebaut wurde.
--> geführte selbstfindung, tu was DU willst, freiwilligkeit, freie entfaltung der eigenen person, psychotherapie mit treue zu naturordnung.

stellt sich immer wieder die frage:
was macht die mehrheit mit der minderheit, die sich als "geborener serienmörder" fühlt?
--> naturfeuer gegen kunstfeuer, "wer richten will, der wird selbst gerichtet".

die dumme lösung: diese leute zu soldaten ausbilden, und dann in "symmetrischen kriegen" verheizen,
damit die mehrheit "befreit" ist von diesen nutzlosen "ballastexistenzen" und "asozialen" [NS jargon], die "zu anspruchsvoll" sind für diese dumme welt.

da vinci: ich erwachte, um den rest schlafen zu sehen.
schiller: mehrheit ist unsinn, verstand ist immer nur bei wenigen.

element feuer. 
che guevara. vladimir lenin. matt damon. jon cryer.

schlau gewinnt

selektion zu mehr schlauheit
bei einer kontrolle gewinnt der, der eine "gute ausrede" parat hat, und "sich" [seine schwäche] nicht provozieren lässt.

wer "publik und privat" am besten trennen kann, der wird am wenigsten bestraft.

wer lange genug eine "falsche rolle" spielen kann, der wird in ruhe gelassen --> gute ausrede

sei schlau, stell dich dumm.

--> nur eine minderheit ist krank,
mehrheit macht alles richtig

feuer wird gegen feuer gehetzt
und "der dritte" freut sich
--> mehrheit der "zivilisten" = nicht-feuer

lebende medien.

= natürliche tele-kommunikation, 
fern-beziehung zu "distant types"

pfade zwischen zwei punkten 
sind immer nur horizontal oder vertikal, nie diagonal.

nur vier punkte (von acht punkten = in einer zeit) 
sind direkt erreichbar. → Kreuz

für die anderen vier punkte brauchen wir "medien", 
als mittelpunkte, brücken, übersetzer, vermittler, 
moderatoren, dolmetscher, interpreten, botschafter.

problem:
dialog über nur ein pfad 
wirkt anti-symmetrisch [biased],
und benachteiligt einen endpunkt.
lösung:
verbindung über zwei verschiedene pfade.
[zu jedem "fernpunkt" gibt es eine gerade zahl von pfaden.]

zu drei punkten (von acht punkten)
brauchen wir nur ein medium.

erzfeind:
zu einem punkt (von acht punkten)
brauchen wir zwei medien.

für diesen "erzfeind punkt" gilt:
gleiches tempo, andere stimmung, anderes geschlecht.
= erster bund, aber mit anderem geschlecht.

autobio.

dies ist meine arbeit der letzten 16 jahre = vom jahr 13 bis zum jahr 29, zwischen pubertät und "reife".









armut und verzweiflung als motiv
marx:
Mögen die herrschenden Klassen vor einer kommunistischen Revolution zittern. 
Die Proletarier haben nichts in ihr zu verlieren als ihre Ketten. Sie haben eine Welt zu gewinnen. 
Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!

Referenz: https://beruhmte-zitate.de/autoren/karl-marx/
marx:
Die Revolutionen sind die Lokomotiven der Geschichte.
Alle Revolutionen haben bisher nur eines bewiesen, nämlich dass sich vieles ändern lässt, bloß nicht die Menschen.
Die Philosophen haben die Welt nur verschieden interpretiert; es kömmt drauf an, sie zu verändern.
Die Gewalt ist der Geburtshelfer jeder alten Gesellschaft, die mit einer neuen schwanger geht.
das Leben bestimmt das Bewußtsein.
Der Mensch macht die Religion


marx:
Verteilung des Eigentums gerecht?
gerechte Verteilung auf Grundlage der Produktionsweise


marx:
"Emanzipation" ist Zurückführung der menschlichen Welt, der Verhältnisse, auf den Menschen selbst.
--> zurück zum selbst + naturordnung

marx:
Die Kinder müssen die Eltern erziehen

marx:
Philosophen sind Wichser,
Studenten sind Ficker.


marx:
Die Kritik der Religion endet mit der Lehre, dass der Mensch das höchste Wesen für den Menschen sei, also 
mit dem kategorischen Imperativ, alle Verhältnisse umzuwerfen, in denen der Mensch ein erniedrigtes, ein geknechtetes, ein verlassenes, ein verächtliches Wesen ist.


marx:
Die Geschichte aller "bisherigen Gesellschaft" ist die Geschichte von Klassenkämpfen. 
Freier und Sklave, Patrizier und Plebejer, Baron und Leibeigener, Zunftbürger und Gesell, kurz, 
Unterdrücker und Unterdrückte standen in stetem Gegensatz zueinander, führten einen (ewigen) Kampf, der jedesmal mit einer 
revolutionären Umgestaltung der ganzen Gesellschaft endete oder mit dem 
gemeinsamen Untergang der kämpfenden Klassen.




marx zu suizid:
Mit der Entwicklung der großen Industrie 
wird also unter den Füßen der Bourgeoisie 
die Grundlage selbst hinweggezogen, 
worauf sie produziert und die Produkte sich aneignet. 
Sie produziert vor allem ihren eigenen Totengräber. 
Ihr Untergang und der Sieg des Proletariats sind gleich unvermeidlich.

marx:
der Genuß wirkt als treibendes Motiv, nicht die Bereicherung.

marx:
Die Bourgeoisie, 
wo sie zur Herrschaft gekommen, 
hat alle feudalen, patriarchalischen, idyllischen Verhältnisse zerstört. 
Sie hat die buntscheckigen Feudalbande, die den Menschen an seinen "natürlichen Vorgesetzten" knüpften, unbarmherzig zerrissen 
und kein anderes Band zwischen Mensch und Mensch übriggelassen als das nackte Interesse, als die gefühllose "bare Zahlung".

marx:
Wir nennen Kommunismus die wirkliche Bewegung, welche den jetzigen Zustand aufhebt.
Kommunismus ist kein Zustand, kein Ideal.
--> ewige suche

marx:
Die Bürokratie gilt sich selbst als der letzte Endzweck des Staates.


marx zu "arbeit macht frei":
Die Gesellschaft findet nun einmal nicht ihr Gleichgewicht, bis sie sich um die Sonne der Arbeit dreht.


marx:
„An die Stelle der alten bürgerlichen Gesellschaft mit ihren Klassen und Klassengegensätzen tritt eine Assoziation, worin die freie Entwicklung eines jeden die Bedingung für die freie Entwicklung aller ist.“

Jugendamt

Ab 1939 übernahmen die Jugendämter als Teil der Staatsgewalt im NS-Staat weitgehend die Kontrolle über die Kinder
erziehung
. Das Jugendamt kontrollierte und lenkte Familien und Kinder von Geburt an

habe als vater kontaktverbot, weil ich böse bin. böse? offene mordlust gegen unwürdige --> beamte reagieren mit: politische verfolgung, sabotage gegen glaubensfreiheit. mutter ist überfordert, großeltern sind weit weg und haben keine zeit. kind leidet, ist extrem alleine, soll zwar per beschluss in die kita, aber kriegt keinen platz, hat null kontakt zu gleichaltrigen [spielt immer nur den passiven beobachter, den verstoßenen, wartet auf rettung die nie kommt], jeder sagt immer wie schön sie ist aber strafen sie mit einsamkeit [schönheit ist ein fluch], wird extrem unterfordert und frustriert, weint schon gleich beim aufwachen, würde am liebsten den ganzen tag nur fernsehen und zucker essen [trauma, weltflucht, abwesend, feuer spielt wasser], wird permanent gefoltert von elektrosmog, ärzte beschuldigen immer "irgendwelche viren" und geben antibiotika und sedativa .... --> zersetzung gegen dissidenten. erpressung, obwohl sich mein "glaube" nie ändern wird --> streit zwischen naturfeuer [ich] und kunstfeuer [beamte] .... diese leute [kunstfeuer] provozieren in einer tour [geiselnahme und erpressung], fragt sich nur: wen suchen die? ich fürchte: die suchen einen "starken gott" der ihren provokationen "endlich" ein ende bereitet. --> endzeit-sekten, die "dieses leben" sowieso hassen [introvertierte, melancholiker] und nur als "zwischenspiel" abwerten, und jeden hassen, der "dieses leben" schön findet [extravertierte, sanguiniker] .... #blah



why is this a secret?
cos "they" seriously do not know better?
[and dont just claim desparation as part of their defense?]

stupid but strong:
They Know Not What They Do
Forgive Them for They Know Not What They Do
from the Bible, specifically Luke 23:34:
Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”[a] And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
When Jesus was crucified, he uttered these words about those who begged for his crucifixion. He asked his father, who, in Christian theology is known as God the Father, for forgiveness of those who asked for his murder.

1:45 the spark of hope, from the fire in our souls, to connect to others .... have we forgotten our fire? name "lena", "leon" --> the matchmaker, the coupler. --> zodiac-sign leo --> element fire = extravert psychotic = sanguinic phlegmatic = heart-shape mesomorph = long palms + short fingers = born "king" = genicos and thanatos in one body = born dominant, made fool .... fire wears green top and white bottom --> green, the color of hope. 

matchmaking is so underrated, since it is still "taboo" to penetrate into privacy of others. "thats my problem, not your problem" -- defense of loneliness and resignation. 

what she calls "intuition" can be perfectly systematized, but only taught to those with talent --> initiate others. 

this relates to the culture of "anabaptism" aka "project rename", and is a heresy to all, who believe in "nomen est omen" and "no way back", and who fanatically cling to "passion", as in "only god can judge, and my god aint real" 

matchmaking must also be expanded to education of children. from day one, kids seek "their people", and their "first parents" are mostly wrong. kids need the right peers [same age], and the right role models [elders]. 

audrey jacobs looks like "element water" to me. long palms + long fingers + small joints. low brow, hook-nose, black-blue dress. mostly monotonous voice. a female charlie sheen. water = introvert psychotic = melancholic phlegmatic = ectomorph. 

i guess, both psychotics [fire and water] have the talent for matchmaking --> strong minds, "intelligent", observe and control, two-step logic, self-correcting, think first and respond later, good programers [both computers and humans], good translators, poets, condensers, abstractors, self-reliant, mentally independent. 

in "deloitte business chemistry": fire = guardian, water = integrator. 

intuition can be perfectly systematized? 
that would finally make this comment unreadable : D

second bond 1--2 [other sex, other tempo],

Fan Question: How many girlfriends has Kenny had?
08.04.2015

Fan Question: Being that Kenny is always obsessed with boobs and chicks… how many girlfriends has he actually had?

Answer: Well, you’re right — Kenny definitely loves boobs. And even though he’s only 10 years old, there’s been a few romances worth noting over the course of his many lives…

The first was with Kelly, a Getting Gay With Kids choir member from Season 3’s “Rainforest Shmainforest”. In fact, Kelly actually saves Kenny’s life at the end of the episode!


But it doesn’t last long. At the beginning of the next episode (after Cartman complains that Kenny’s “spending way too much time” with his new girlfriend), Kenny spontaneously explodes.

The second (and probably most famous) relationship was with the notorious whore Tammy Warner in Season 13’s “The Ring”. Unfortunately, their relationship also ended poorly… Kenny died from a tragic case of syphilis.


Lastly — it’s also worth mentioning Kenny’s hot chick from “Major Boobage”. Even though she only showed up when Kenny was cheesed out of his mind, they still had a pretty wild ride together…
