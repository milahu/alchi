**humans and their relations** are the last secret of this world ...

lets decode this last secret!

in our view, **psychology and sociology** must be seen as one science.  
both psychology and sociology are only two sides of one coin.  
this one science is the science of mental chemistry, in short: alchemy

## abstract

our main hypothesis is our compatibility chart:

<img src="./src/images/alchi-compatibility-chart-gender-element.svg">

the compatibility chart works in two ways:

1. i know who i am, but who are my friends?
2. i know my friends, but who am i?

the validity of the compatibility chart can be verified  
in a scientific experiment (experimental psychology).

challenges:

1. measuring of personality type (four basetypes)
2. measuring of "relationship quality" (sympathy, understanding, interpersonal compatibility)
3. invasive experiment. invading into "private" matters, "unethical", therapy by force?
4. city environment is inherently toxic, reinforcing bad habits. ecovillages can provide a better setting,  
but usually, personality types are **not** balanced (the usual "mental incest" and "confirm bias".  
"balanced types" is a hard requirement for this experiment.)
5. our time is running out. world war 3 is only weeks away. (now you can call me a pessimist.)

## packages

this repository is organized as a monorepo of multiple packages

* [src/alchi-book/](src/alchi-book/)
* [src/alchi-flyer/](src/alchi-flyer/)
* [src/alchi-tables/](src/alchi-tables/)
* [src/alchi-maps/](src/alchi-maps/)
* [src/alchi-test/](src/alchi-test/)

a monorepo is easier to backup, and usually our readers need all packages

### releases

we try to release all our content as **single file apps**
which can be simply opened in any web browser,  
without [installing node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
and without starting a local web server

[//]: # ( usually with `npm install` and `npm run start` or `npm run dev` )
[//]: # ( cost: larger repository )

we can open markdown files offline with (for example) the [Markdown Preview Plus](https://www.crx4chrome.com/extensions/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl/) chrome extension  
(in `chrome://extensions` enable `Allow access to file URLs`)

### more content

this project is still a work-in-progress.
ideally, all the text-files and images
would be merged into the alchi-book:

* [english/](english/)
* [deutsch/](deutsch/)
* [src/images/](src/images/) (todo: remove old files)

### permalinks

a note to myself and other contributors:

when moving files, make sure that the old URLs are still reachable

ideally replace the old file with a relative link to the new location, like

```html
<html>
moved to <a href="path/to/new/file.html">path/to/new/file.html</a>
</html>
```

## download

all files and versions can be downloaded with the linux command

```txt
git clone https://github.com/milahu/alchi.git
```

the program `git` is also available for [Windows, Android, Apple, etc.](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/)

this also works with our [repo mirrors](#repo-mirrors)

## future work

* english synth (see [src/alchi-book](src/alchi-book))
* handout = one page summary (see [de](deutsch/alchi-flyer.html) and [en](english/alchi-flyer.en.html), but they are very hard to read)
* video (for example: how to [Construct the Map Of Sixteen Types](src/alchi-book/src/pages/page-020.html) from scratch)
* proof of concept

## work in progress

finishing my project is my "running away balloon":

[<img
  width="250"
  src="src/images/meme.running-away-balloon.finish-my-project-vs-distractions.jpeg"
  alt="meme: running away balloon: finish my project vs distractions"
  title="meme: running away balloon: finish my project vs distractions"
/>](src/images/meme.running-away-balloon.finish-my-project-vs-distractions.jpeg)

the closer i get to my finish line, the harder becomes my work,
and that with an exponential increase

i guess that is why broad-tops (fire and air) like me (fire)
need long-tops (earth and water):  
broad-tops easily start new work (find new distractions)
and long-tops easily "get shit done",  
assuming the long-top has experience with this job

## translations

i am in the process of making english the default language

i started this project in german, since german is my native language,
and i wanted to publish my work offline to the people in my region,
to realize and test my concept ...
this approach has failed, since

* most "interesting subjects" (children)
are ridiculously overprotected by their parents, teachers and police
* most people in my region have a ridiculous trust in their government,
so they are zero prepared for the coming collapse

plan B:
publish my work to online communities (doomsday preppers, personality psychology, ...)
where my work can at least be preserved for future generations,
and where my work can be reviewed (at least superficially) by other psychology scholars

the [alchi-book](src/alchi-book/) package is the current focus of my work.
the english and german versions are about 80% ready.
i have already added auto-translations for:
chinese, spanish, russian, turkish, farsi, arabic, czech, hungarian.
adding a new auto-translation with [translate.js](src/alchi-book/scripts/translate.js)
can now be done in five minutes or less.

* [src/alchi-book/scripts/translate.js](src/alchi-book/scripts/translate.js)  
node.js script to export text fragments to [google translate](http://translate.google.com/),
and to import translations back to [src/alchi-book/src/pages/](src/alchi-book/src/pages/).
the imported text fragments look like `<lang.ar rev="en#L1S/h9eR">`
and must be fixed manually, since auto-translate is never perfect.
* [src/alchi-book/src/\_data/metadata.js](src/alchi-book/src/_data/metadata.js) - see `languages`.
this is a space-separeted list of all languages codes for the language menu

### absence

In case of milahu's absence ... milahu cannot help you, and you are on your own

milahu does have some enemies, who want him broken, in jail or dead ...

<!-- ^ funny how people misunderstand this. just another intelligence test -->

What milahu has published here is only a part of his hand-written diary,  
but it should be enough information to realize and test his concept

### wrong

In case milahu's concept is wrong:

Let him quote the alchi-book ([src/alchi-book/src/pages/page-150.html](src/alchi-book/src/pages/page-150.html)):

> Doubt: Just a theory / vision / daydream?
>
> When our map is wrong:  
> The 16 types of people are real
> (4 bodies times 4 elements),  
> and when you put them all in one place  
> then they will
> find the natural order by themself
> (self-organisation).  
>  
> Other worldviews are also "just a theory"
> and only because other experiments  
> have been running for a long time,
> they are not automatically better.  
> More competition please!  
>  
> And, trying is better than studying:  
> We can compare a theory
> only after we have tried it.  
>  
> When someone wants to attack a good theory  
> he will distract from the topic
> and argue with false reasons  
> (superficial, formal criticism, pseudo-problems).

<!-- spam

#### keepalive

Technically, milahu could publish "keepalive messages" every day,
but for that he would need a "perfect private key".

In reality, an attacker would only need to torture him,
so he reveals his private key,
and then the attacker could takeover all his accounts (ID theft)

Or milahu could setup a "dead man switch", but ... nah

milahu prefers to rely on his reader's brains,
and he hopes that people [download the full alchi repository](#download),
so they can see the full edit history of all files

An attacker would leave traces in the edit history,
similar to Wikipedia,
or he would have to rewrite the git history,
in that case a `git pull` would fail to update any local files

The best way to authenticate milahu is to meet him in person.
milahu's location is near Munich, Germany.
