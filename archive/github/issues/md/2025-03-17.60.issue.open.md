## Panama Going Hot -- Important Update

Massive protests planned over Social Security and other internal matters

[Michael Yon](https://substack.com/@michaelyon)

2025-03-17

Note from important source:

About 68 **Labor unions** met today. They agreed to protest on Tuesday.
They confirm once again their resolve to **shut down the country
starting Friday, March 21.**

Labor unions are preparing to indefinitely shut down Panama. Friday will
be the big deal. All will be blocked. Most services discontinued.
Including construction, schools, medical services, some security-related
jobs, ports, and port services.

Note from Michael Yon: I am told there is no plan to forcibly close the
Canal. **Roads leading to Canal and ports are to be forcibly closed.
This is violation of treaty and could lead to U.S. invasion. Trump has
ordered U.S. military to plan for invasion.**
