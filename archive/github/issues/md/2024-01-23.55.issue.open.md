## Gab Stands Up to Censorship Requests from Europol

Dear Gab users,

We want to bring your attention to a recent development that highlights
the importance of our ongoing commitment to free speech and our
dedication to protecting your rights on our platform.

This morning, Europol, a European Union law enforcement agency, [reached
out to Gab, demanding that we censor
links](https://gab.com/a/posts/111799850135725666) to a documentary
called [Europa The Last
Battle](https://solidtorrents.to/search?q=europa+the+last+battle).
Europol claims that the documentary violates their laws and should be
removed from our platform.

For those unfamiliar, Europol is a European Union agency responsible for
coordinating the sharing of information and intelligence between law
enforcement agencies across 27 EU member states. While Europol may have
a significant role in maintaining law and order within the European
Union, we must remain vigilant in ensuring that their requests do not
infringe upon our users' rights to free speech and expression.

As a platform that values and upholds the principles of free speech, we
will not be removing the documentary from Gab. We believe that the First
Amendment protects the rights of our users to share and access
information, even if it may be considered controversial by some.

We have chosen to stand up to Europol's censorship request. These
decisions to stand up to foreign government requests incur a significant
amount of legal costs to handle these situations. However, we believe
that this is a worthy investment to ensure that free speech is protected
from censorship by foreign governments.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our users who have
supported us in our mission to provide a platform that respects and
protects free speech. We encourage you to continue standing with us as
we navigate these challenges together.

If you believe in our cause and would like to support our efforts to
maintain a free and open platform, please consider upgrading to GabPRO,
making a one-time donation or purchase from our shop, or running ads for
your business or brand on Gab.

Thank you for your continued support and for helping us keep the spirit
of free speech alive.

Sincerely,

The Gab Team

Europol just emailed us and demanded that we remove a post someone made
on Gab sharing a link to the documentary Europa The Last Battle. Not
only will we not be removing it, but I’ll also share the link here and
encourage you to watch the documentary that the EU cronies are terrified
of you watching.

<blockquote>

In our assessment, the content referred incites to hatred by either
threatening, taunting, offending a targeted group and it involves, but
might not be limited to, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, homophobia,
or other forms of discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ collective.

\[The content violates Article 1 of the [EU Council Framework Decision
2008/913/JHA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008F0913)
of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms of expressions of racism
and xenophobia by means of criminal law\]

We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Kind regards

Excellent post, very good film that exposes some of the hidden history

Gab might be the last real FREE SPEECH site on the internet.

272 politicians of European Parliament were on (((György Soros)))

Evil people are bothered by a documentary spreading the truth.  
Because with the Jewish lies deunked they no longer can market their
satanic supremacy as "good side of the history".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The power that be are pissing their plants in fear that the masses are
waking up! But a 12+ hour video requires a lot of stamina to get through
it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EU along with any other Globalist operation has gotta get it through
their thick heads that no one has the authority to control the free-flow
of information, ideas, thoughts and opinions.

Fuck ‘em

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The truth is a “threat” to their Jewish supremacy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great movie.

I think I will watch it a third time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why these people think that if you have refused 1000
censorship requests you will suddenly respond to 1001. Does Europol
think it is somehow special in comparison to various national
governments?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

... and these people still have the audacity to call themselves "anti"
fascists

we (males of the old population) are expected to shut up and keep
working and keep paying taxes, while our countries are invaded by
african males, financed by our tax money

this censorship is an overreach, because the contents per se are not
illegal, but they claim: these contents are a danger to the public
peace. makes sense, because if too many people "wake up", they will
revolt

so this censorship is their way to prevent a bottom-up revolution
("insurrection"), and to protect their top-down revolution, to stay in
control. no surprise, fascists are control freaks

<blockquote>

## BMJ Report Recommends “Behavioral Interventions” To “Reduce Vaccine Hesitancy Driven by Misinformation on Social Media”

These interventions include boosting the visibility of "reliable health
information" and social media companies becoming "more proactive in
dealing with the proliferation of misinformation on their sites."

[By Didi Rankovic](https://reclaimthenet.org/author/dee-rankovic)

The BMJ is not short for “Behavioral Medical Journal” – but it might as
well be.

Now this publication, owned by the British Medical Association, is
exploring how to deploy no less than “behavioral interventions” to bring
about less “vaccine hesitancy.”

And [the article](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076542)
doesn’t stop at medical arguments. The hesitancy here is specifically
linked with social media driven “misinformation.”

The recommendations don’t differ greatly from what those Big Tech social
subsidiaries have been including for years in their policies – and these
“guidelines” were probably cooked in the same kitchen, so to speak.

Things like, boosting the visibility of “reliable health information”
and more “pro-action” on these platforms “in dealing with the
proliferation of misinformation.”

First, the authors of the piece seek to define the way in which social
media affects vaccination campaigns. The take is basically entirely
negative – asserting that this effect amounts to misinformation only.

Paying lip service to genuine safety concerns playing a role in low
uptake, the BMJ instantly switches back to playing up the danger of
hesitancy.

Thus – there’s been a “return of measles” as of late. And, the
implication is, the World Health Organization (WHO) used that among
other things to issue an extreme “decree” to the world – that vaccine
hesitancy is “among the greatest threats to global health,” WHO said.

And while the article positions the concern about vaccination in general
– including decades-long used and tested ones – the highly controversial
Covid jab eventually makes an appearance.

And it is mentioned as that point where this general “hesitancy” gained
momentum, with the social media – rather than the sketchy nature of
these particular vaccines – to blame.

Now for the “solutions,” specifically those based on behavioral
interventions methods, or let’s say, “reprogramming.”

Here’s what BMJ says are standard behavioral approaches: encouraging
vaccination by “(including) mandatory vaccination and regulation for
healthcare professionals, incentives, public health communication
campaigns, and engaging trusted leaders.”

Don’t feel bad if the term “orchestrated campaign” occurs to you as you
read the BMJ mentioning “pre-bunking” information as one way to deal
with this problem of its own making. “Pre-bunking” enthusiasts are now
cropping up all over the place.

And there’s more ways to inoculate people than just against viruses –
there’s also manipulative “inoculation” against broad-minded
consideration of all available information.

The BMJ says: “Other intervention types include warning (‘inoculating’)
people about manipulation tactics using non-harmful exposure as a tool
to identify misinformation, and using accuracy prompts to trigger people
to consider the truthfulness of material they are about to share on
social media platforms, without stopping them from posting.”

## Treasonous SCOTUS orders full-scale migrant invasion of America in final act of national suicide

The U.S. Supreme Court just ordered Texas to allow the full-scale
migrant invasion that's overrunning America, ruling that any defensive
barriers are illegal.

Is this how the civil war begins? Texas is adamant that its borders must
be protected against invasion. In fact, the U.S. Constitution demands
that the federal government protect states from invasion, yet SCOTUS is
acting in a way that is thoroughly complicit in an active, wartime
invasion and occupation of the United States of America.

The intention is clear: To overrun America, exterminate all Americans
and replace them with imported illegals who have no ties to the
Constitution or American culture.

Plus today, we feature an interview with David Webb of "The Great
Taking" who describes how the engineered mass theft of your financial
assets has been carefully planned and is about to be activated.

## Trump wins again, crypto and gold beat counterfeit currency

Trump just clobbered Nikki Haley in New Hampshire and the GOP nomination
is all but wrapped up now. It's Trump vs. whoever the Democrats decide
to run, and a lot of people think that's going to be "Big Mike."

Today we also cover the superiority of private crypto and gold as
systems that store value. They are valuable because governments cannot
counterfeit them, and confiscation is also nearly impossible for
governments to achieve.

Remember: **Governments don't want you to use any system of money that
they can't surveil, confiscate and counterfeit. That's why they oppose
gold, silver and crypto while promoting dollar-denominated bank
accounts, treasuries, IRAs and CBDCs.**

Mike, **why do you continue to push Trump propaganda non-stop just like
Alex Jones?**

While in office, Trump:

1.  Took credit for and promoted Warp Speed even though publicly
    available studies exposed how every animal injected with **mRNA**
    DIED!!
2.  STILL **brags about and promotes those shots** even though a
    MOUNTAIN of studies, statistics and testimonials PROVE how deadly
    they are.
3.  He approved the final installation of **deadly 5G towers on every
    street corner** even though DECADES of studies and expert testimony
    reveal how harmful it is, especially to children.
4.  **He signed Int'l agreements and EO's that give a future President
    and/or FOREIGN entities i.e. UN/WHO, the immediate power to remove
    what few God given rights we have left if an 'emergency' is
    declared.**
5.  **He ignored Assange** being incarcerated AND tortured for simply
    receiving and publicly posting evidence of actions taken by evil,
    corrupt segments of the US gov't.

**While he did say a lot of things that we liked hearing, everything he
did supported and forwarded the Rothschild (formerly the Bauer
family)/Rockefeller agenda against humanity. This is NOT a
coincidence.**

I won't even go into Trumps length friendship with Epstein (who still
lives); how he announced "lock her up" referring to Killary, but then
publicly stated that the Clintons were "good people"; or his lengthy
collaboration with both the Rothschild and Rockefeller banks.

Trump is and always has been a Rothschild/Rockefeller puppet. **THEY
have followed the manual on 'Creating Controlled Opposition'** to a T
with how they've used Trump to trigger the left and manipulate the
right, playing us all against one another. But I digress.

Please Mike, stop promoting Trump and his "successes". And stop posting
stories about a PERCEIVED attack on him by the 'swamp'. You will notice
that NONE of the legal or character attacks on him are fruitful. This is
because they are intended to fail. **They are part of creating
controlled opposition.** The left celebrates the attacks on Trump (even
though they don't realize they are empty attacks), and the right thinks
that their golden boy is unfairly attacked by a corrupt system that the
left is manipulating. It is ALL theatrics.

Please wake up

[Aphropsyche](https://www.brighteon.com/channels/aphropsyche)

Like Musk, which has been obvious from miles away, Trump is Jew-ISH,
too, as are **all these wolves in sheep's clothing**. Evil never shows
up with bared fangs and extended claws but with **mellifluous promises
and sweet nothings that lull their victims into a false sense of
security so they can move in undetected for the kill.**

From The Atlantic, ["Trump Secretly Mocks His Christian
Supporters"](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-secretly-mocks-his-christian-supporters/616522/)

Mike, you guys are having this discussion as if our government and world

## Texas Gov defies Biden's treason as pro-America states form battle lines to defend against invasion

The Governor of Texas has defied the lawless, unconstitutional SCOTUS
order that demands Texas open its border and allow an unlimited invasion
of enemy combatants into the country.

Gov. Abbott has invoked the U.S. Constitution to declare that the rights
of Texas supersede the federal government's powers.

Treasonous democrats are calling for Biden to seize control of the Texas
National Guard. But Oklahoma, Virginia, Florida and other states have
declared they will stand with Texas.

We are rapidly advancing into a civil war scenario over illegal
immigration, and the illegal Biden regime will stop at nothing to see
America completely destroyed and all its citizens exterminated.

This is a fight for our very survival.

When succession collectively occurs across the country , and the USA
economy and dollar collapses simultaneously , the USA will be horribly
weakened. That's when China with UN support will invade the continent ,
activate their sleeper cells that have poured across the border for 3
years straight and take us over .

This scenario is exactly what the globalists want .

To think that China will not take this opportunity to invade then your
head is someplace where the sun don't shine.

Either way the USA, Canada and South America are thoroughly fucked .

Get locked, loaded, and stocked up with food and energy and protect your
families.

Hey Mike, I have said it a few times on this channel: Greg Abbott is a
WEF member. Truth is, Abbott could have stopped all of this back in
2021. This is all part of “their” plan. This is how this finally
destroys our country and breaks it up into regions just as they planned.
This back and forth between Biden and Abbott is all show and used to
kick off the civil war, which will lead to tens of millions of Americans
dead, just as they planned. Once again, Abbott could have done something
way before he allowed roughly 20 million invaders. The 6 million must be
only from the TX border. Here is the current WEF link:

## Twelve states sound the alarm: Globalist banks are conspiring with the UN to wipe out U.S. farms and food production

by Mike Adams

A massive fire at Feather Crest Farms in Texas raises suspicions of more
food sabotage, as multiple chicken houses burn down. More sabotage
appears to be under way against the U.S. food infrastructure.

Meanwhile, agricultural commissioners representing 12 U.S. states have
issued a huge warning to globalist megabanks, saying their **ESG
investing guidelines are essentially a war on farms and will result in
the collapse of U.S. farming and food infrastructure.**

Of course, that's the globalist plan, right?

## Chicken Plant Fire in Texas: More Food Sabotage?

A massive fire at Feather Crest Farms in Texas raises suspicions of more
**food sabotage**, as multiple chicken houses burn down, leading to a
loss of life for many chickens. This adds to the ongoing **concerns
about the safety of our food supply chain**, as well as the **need for

## Texas chicken farm engulfed for hours in massive blaze

Authorities said that over 100 firefighters were working to extinguish
the blaze on Tuesday

Published January 30, 2024 8:00pm EST

A massive fire engulfed a chicken farm in Texas, demolishing the chicken
coop, with firefighters still working to extinguish the blaze on
Tuesday.

The Bryan Fire Department shared images of the fire, which showed huge
flames and a giant plume of smoke at Feather Crest Chicken Farm, which
is owned by MPS Egg Farms.

The sheriff's office said it received a call about the fire on Monday
evening around 5 p.m., adding that multiple fire departments remained at
the scene Tuesday.

According to authorities, on Tuesday afternoon over 100 firefighters
were still working to put out the blaze.

Officials said multiple factors worked against the firefighters, who
worked throughout the night to put out the massive blaze that had
erupted throughout the metal buildings.

Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire.

The farm, which is located over 100 miles north of Houston, is **in a
remote area without any nearby fire hydrants**, forcing responding
departments to rely on a water shuttle system.

Feather Crest Farms CEO Sam Krouse told Scripps News Waco said that no
one was injured during the fire and that two chicken homes perished in
the blaze.

"The fire affected two chicken houses on site, and we are very sad to
say one house had chickens in it at the time that have been lost,"
Krouse told the local station.

"We are thankful for the swift actions of our entire team and that they
are all safe. We also deeply appreciate the first responders who reached
the farm quickly and helped to prevent any further damage," he said.

## List of 103 U.S. Food Manufacturing Facilities Destroyed Under Biden Admin

“There are currently no nationwide shortages of food,” claims the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.

QUICK FACTS:

-   Although there are now **more than a hundred food processing plants
    that have been destroyed across the country**, the U.S. Department
    of Agriculture has repeatedly
    [denied](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/09/updated-list-us-based-food-manufacturing-plants-destroyed-biden-regime-can-now-participate-add-incidents-interactive-map/)
    “disruptions.”
-   This denial comes despite the fact that while 135 million people
    faced acute food insecurity before the COVID-19 pandemic, that
    number has more than
    [doubled](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-food-shortage-bad-to-worse-un-world-food-programme-102938562.html)
    to 276 million over the last two years.
-   It’s also despite **U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) Chief Economist
    Arif Husain saying of food shortages around the world, “It’s the
    story that keeps getting from bad to worse”** and “When the World
    Food Programme is setting records, that’s not a good thing for the
    world. And we have been doing that since at least 2021.”
-   In fact, one Associated Press (AP) news release
    [reported](https://apnews.com/press-release/news-direct-corporation/lifestyle-9fb6b075dde64ca86c1b837ef447935f)
    that “tens of millions of Americans are already feeling the
    shortages and price hikes” and that **these “alarming trends are
    expected to continue and worsen** in 2023.”
-   And Quartz recently
    [reported](https://qz.com/supply-chain-problems-are-getting-worse-not-better-fo-1849506510)
    how a “recent survey from the Food Industry Association (FMI), a
    trade organization that represents food retailers and wholesalers,
    found that 70% of retailers said supply chain disruptions are
    negatively impacting their business, up from 42% the year before.”
-   “There are currently no nationwide shortages of food,” the
    department’s website nevertheless
    [reads](https://www.usda.gov/coronavirus/food-supply-chain),
    “although in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your
    grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock.”
    “There are currently no wide-spread disruptions reported in the
    supply chain,” the agency reiterated.
-   The Department of Agriculture holds its position notwithstanding Joe
    Biden’s [own
    warnings](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-americans-food-shortage-gonna-be-real-following-sanctions-russia)

## Senate deal surrenders America to invading illegals as blue cities panic

by Mike Adams

A new "deal" in the US Senate allows 5,000 illegals per day to invade
the USA, while sending insane billions of dollars to both Ukraine and
Israel.

Astonishingly, the money for Ukraine is earmarked to "protect Ukraine's
borders" while the U.S. borders remain wide open.

Denver is now at a "breaking point" according to its mayor, and NYC is
headed for "collapse" due to the ongoing invasion. Yet almost no one in
the Senate will demand ZERO illegals crossing the border.

We have been sold out by traitors. I'm seeing more people online calling

order some bureaucracy to do something and he was just ignored. One of
the most popular Presidents in history and the swamp ignored him when
they so desired. A President in only a powerful as the tenured

every executive order because that is what they desire. Trump had four

## WHO Report Proposes Working With Social Media Providers and Law Enforcement To Control “Disinformation”

The WHO is increasingly encroaching on online speech.

by [Didi Rankovic](https://reclaimthenet.org/author/dee-rankovic)

The United Nations (UN) in general has in the past years proved to be a
fine yet unfortunate example of the degradation of an institution that
was conceived as an international forum for settling disputes and
establishing cooperation and mutual trust between countries – without
denting their sovereignty or agency.

Yet from that, it has been turning into **another “brick in the
globalist wall”** – instead of providing a level playing field and
ensuring trust, **the UN is prostrating itself and its various agencies
– these last years very notably the WHO (World Health Organization) –
before the global agendas.**

Therefore, it’s really unsurprising that the World Health Organization
continues to dabble in **online information suppression and even
censorship**, and keeps talking about “disinformation.”

As well, a recent WHO statement gives away that the UN wouldn’t mind
following in the footsteps of governments who **collude with Big Tech**.
After all, **the UN has been pejoratively referred to as “the world
government.”**

These days, WHO’s top-of-mind goes this way, as per the post. **It’s not
the actual health issues, but – “cyber-attacks on health care (and)
disinformation.” And these are treated as “health security risks.”**

So, not health risks – but “health security risks.” There is also talk
about “enhancing cyber-maturity.” **It will be a cold day in hell before
most people catch up with corporate/globalist newspeak** anyway, but
this time in a post on the [WHO
blog](https://www.who.int/news/item/06-02-2024-who-reports-outline-responses-to-cyber-attacks-on-health-care-and-the-rise-of-disinformation-in-public-health-emergencies),
the agency at least listed everyone involved in this curious endeavor.

It’s no less that Interpol (a global police organization), the UN Office
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the **UN Office of Counter-terrorism**, the
UN International Computing Center (UNICC), the UN Inter-regional Crime
and Justice Research Institute, and the **CyberPeace Institute**.

Wow. The post goes on to justify all this by asserting that during The
pandemic, the IT infrastructure of healthcare institutions got targeted,
apparently more so than usual.

**“Disinformation”** is, strangely, not defined here as – well,
disinformation. Instead, it’s – possibly more tellingly than the WHO
would have liked it to come across – described as, **“a weaponization of
information.”**

And now for the **proposed solutions**. One is to **raise awareness of
disinformation and information manipulation (but does the WHO really
want this, since its own activities just might get exposed as such?)**

Inevitably, we come to (Big Tech’s, really) **promotion of “trusted
sources of information and voices of authority**; supporting
fact-checking activities which include the use of fact-checking
technologies and human **fact-checkers**.”

As a matter of curiosity, here’s how the WHO post concludes:

> “The reports (from previously here listed UN agencies) justify the
> **critical need to build multisectoral alliances** that can harness
> the benefits of new technologies for **improved health and well-being
> while facing constantly emerging threats**.”

Now – did some human actually write that globalist word salad?

We’ll only find out by living and learning. And by keeping tuned.

## Suicide squad - G7 plan to steal Russia’s frozen assets will utterly destroy the U.S. dollar

by Mike Adams

The G7 nations are plotting a new lawfare attack to steal Russia's 300
billion dollars in "frozen" assets, essentially declaring that the
dollar and all western banks will pillage and steal whatever they want.

If this takes place, the rest of the world will panic sell US dollar
holdings and evacuate western banks as quickly as possible, leading to a
cascading collapse of the dollar and western economies.

Yet the sheer stupidity and arrogance of the West is now pushing G7
nations toward exactly this maneuver. I call it a "suicide squad" move,
because if activated, it will lead to the currency and economic suicide
of western nations.

It isn't just happening on the macro level. The local township here in
Ohio with the help and instruction of the corrupt prosecutor's office,
repeatedly came out and robbed me of my vehicles, tools, trailers, etc.,
basically anything they could get their hands on, by abusing process
without even going to court.

Then they charge your property taxes for the entertainment of stealing
from you. They even condemned my house and tore it down, destroying a
lifetime of my work (I always, like you, plowed my profits back into
assets, and they ended up destroying and stealing a good deal of it,
including many income streams I have been working on developing for most
my adult life), and generational wealth. All through abuse of process
and never going to court.

Then they haul you into court for the expense, and steal the land too
AND try to collect the the expense on a personal level also, despite
code saying they can only do one or the other (and that is just the tip
of the iceberg as far as corrupt).

And I'm not the only one they have done it to. They abuse process to
keep the entire county, and other counties do the same thing, from being
able to function on their property, unless you are in the clique, then
you can do whatever you want. Feudal serfs have more rights than we do
as far as using our property. It is IMO how they are implementing agenda
2030, etc.

I'm sure they don't like that I'm not a lefty either and certainly have
been vocal (and somewhat effective) for decades, though mainly on the
net. They are not shy about telling you they are crooks either. I told
the one worker who I thought still had some decency left what they were
doing with abuse of process wasn't due process, and you could see the
complete change in him go vile and demonic, and he said, "If Obama can
do it, we can do it!"

Basically they would just send out vague process that you were some how
in violation of some code, and then when you don't comply, because you
have no idea how you are violation (and they won't tell you or put it in
writing), they just use it as a writ of assistance or general warrant,
to come out and rob you whatever they feel like, without ever going into
court. Especially when they know you aren't there to stop them.

Good luck in finding a lawyer who will sue them. I had one that I went
up and taught title 43, section 1983 code to that was going to sue them
the first time, that was keeping them somewhat on a leash, but when he
died it wasn't a week later they were out robbing us again, and it was
down hill from there.

I have them in court over it doing the best I can, and I could win, but
the court system isn't exactly honest either. This is the kind of crud
we went to war the first time over.

## How Bad Therapy Hijacked Our Nation’s Schools

Forget the Pledge of Allegiance. Today’s teachers are more likely to
start the school day with an ‘emotions check-in.’ Abigail Shrier on the
rise of ‘trauma-informed’ education.

By [Abigail Shrier](https://www.thefp.com/t/abigail-shrier)

American kids are the freest, most privileged kids in all of history.
They are also the saddest, most anxious, depressed, and medicated
generation on record. Nearly a third of teen girls say they have
seriously considered suicide. For boys, that number is an also alarming
14 percent.

What’s even stranger is that all of these worsening mental health
outcomes for kids have coincided with a generation of parents
hyper-fixated on the mental health and well-being of their children.

What’s going on?

That mystery is the subject of Abigail Shrier’s fascinating, urgent new
book: [Bad Therapy: Why the Kids Aren’t Growing
Up](https://bookshop.org/p/books/bad-therapy-why-the-kids-aren-t-growing-up-abigail-shrier/20644918?ean=9780593542927)
\[[annas-archive.org](https://annas-archive.org/search?q=Abigail+Shrier+Bad+Therapy)\].

Longtime readers of The Free Press will surely know Abigail’s name from
her [groundbreaking
reporting](https://www.thefp.com/p/top-trans-doctors-blow-the-whistle)
in our pages. She is also the author of the best-selling 2020 book
[Irreversible
Damage](https://annas-archive.org/search?q=Abigail+Shrier+Irreversible+Damage),
which tackled the difficult subject of the enormous rise of gender
dysphoria among teenage girls. It was named by The Economist as one of
the best books of the year and has been translated into ten languages.

In Bad Therapy, out today, Abigail heads into the breach once more. The
book makes the case that the advent of therapy culture, the rise of
“gentle parenting,” and the spread of “social-emotional learning” in
schools is actually causing much of the anxiety and depression faced by
today’s youth. In other words, Abigail argues that in our attempt to
keep kids safe, we are failing the next generation of American adults.

The best journalists are fearless. And that adjective certainly applies
to Abigail, whose bravery in following the evidence wherever it leads is
what has made her work on some of the most important and controversial
issues of the day so essential.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most American kids today are not in therapy. But the vast majority are
in school, where therapists and non-therapists diagnose kids liberally,
and offer in-school counseling and mental health and wellness
instruction. By 2022, 96 percent of public schools offered mental health
services to students. Many of these interventions constitute what I call
“bad therapy”: they target the healthy, inadvertently exacerbating kids’
worry, sadness, and feelings of incapacity.

Since a child’s first mental or behavioral diagnosis often comes from
school, the Child Mind Institute—one of the premier nonprofits devoted
to adolescent mental health—provides an online “[symptom
checker](https://childmind.org/symptomchecker/)” specifically to help
parents or teachers inform themselves about “possible diagnoses.”

I began to wonder what schools were doing in the name of improving kids’
mental health. I was in luck. Each year, the state of California
sponsors a three-day public school teachers’ conference to showcase its
vast array of emotional and behavioral services. Immediately, I
registered. That is how, in July of 2022, I came to join more than 2,000
public school teachers at the Anaheim Convention Center, right next to
Disneyland.

At the convention, ankle tattoos winked over fresh pedicures, Anne
Taylor cardigans abounded, and the occasional mohawk sliced indoor air
cool enough to crisp celery. We talked about “brain science” based on a
YouTube video many of us had seen. It explained that the brain is like a
hand, with the thumb folded into the palm. “Our amygdala is really
important in serious situations,” said the voice-over. This sounded
right. We felt like neuroscientists.

We lamented the burdens placed upon school counselors, now part of an
expanded psychology staff, which oversees every public school the way
diversity officers dominate a university. We were leery of these new
bosses, but we had to admit, they had a big job to do. Our kiddos were
bonkers. (The word we were careful to use was dysregulated.) Counselors
now routinely monitored the social-emotional quality of our teaching,
sniffed out emotional disturbance in our students, and decided what
assignments to nix or grades to adjust upward.

We talked about the need to give kids “brain breaks,” the salvific power
of “Mindfulness Minutes,” and the importance of ending each day with an
“optimistic closure.” Our purview was the “whole child,” meaning we
needed to evaluate and track kids’ “social and emotional” abilities in
addition to academic ones. Our mandate: “trauma-informed education.” We
pledged to treat all kids as if they had experienced some debilitating
trauma.

Subsequent interviews with dozens of teachers, school counselors, and
parents across the country banished all doubt: therapists weren’t the
only ones practicing bad therapy on kids. Often traveling under the name
“social-emotional learning,” bad therapy had gone airborne.

When I first heard the term social-emotional learning, I assumed a hokey
but necessary call for kids to get a grip. Or maybe it was the new name
for what they used to call character education: treat people kindly,
disagree respectfully, don’t be a jackass. Proponents insist it arrives
at those things, albeit through the somewhat circuitous route of mental
health. Sometimes described by enthusiasts as “a way of life,”
social-emotional learning is the curricular juggernaut that devours
billions in education spending each year and more than eight percent of
teacher time. (Many teachers say they try to ensure that
social-emotional learning happens all day long.) Through a series of
prompts and exercises, SEL pushes kids toward a series of personal
reflections, aimed at teaching them “self-awareness,” “social
awareness,” “relationship skills,” “self-management,” and “responsible
decision-making.”

### Morning Emotions Check-in

Forget the Pledge of Allegiance. Today’s teachers are more likely to
inaugurate the school day with an “emotions check-in.”

School counselor Natalie Sedano advised our assembled conference room of
teachers to ask kids: “How are you feeling today? Are you daisy-bright,
happy and friendly? Or am I a ladybug? Will I fly away if we get too
close?”

This prompted great excitement in the audience, and teachers jumped up
to share their own “emotions check-ins.” One teacher said every day, she
asks her kids if they feel it’s a “bones” or “no bones” kind of a day,
borrowing the verbiage from a viral TikTok video in which a pug owner
shares the mood of his 13-year-old pug, Noodle. If Noodle sits upright,
it’s a bones day! If he collapses, it’s a no-bones day.

“That is so fun!” Sedano enthused. “Love it! Thank you!”

I asked Leif Kennair, a world-renowned expert in the treatment of
anxiety, and Michael Linden, a professor of psychiatry at the Charité
University Hospital in Berlin, what they thought of practice. Both said
this unceasing attention to feelings was likely to make kids more
dysregulated.

If we want to help kids with emotional regulation, what should we
communicate instead?

“I’d say: worry less. Ruminate less,” Kennair told me. “Try to verbalize
everything you feel less. Try to self-monitor and be mindful of
everything you do—less.”

There’s another problem posed by emotions check-ins: they tend to induce
a state orientation at school, potentially sabotaging kids’ abilities to
complete the tasks in front of them.

Many psychological studies back this up. An individual is more likely to
meet a challenge if she focuses on the task ahead, rather than her own
emotional state. If she’s thinking about herself, she’s less likely to
meet any challenge.

“If you want to, let’s say, climb a mountain, if you start asking
yourself after two steps, ‘How do I feel?’ you’ll stay at the bottom,”
Dr. Linden said.

### Ethical Violations

In 2022, California announced a plan to hire an additional [ten
thousand](https://edsource.org/2022/bill-would-give-25000-to-aspiring-school-counselors-social-workers/673790)
counselors in order to address young people’s poor mental health. A new
law encourages California school districts to bill federal Medicaid for
mental health services allocated to kids in school. Meaning, however
much in-school therapy kids have already received, they likely will soon
be getting much more. California school psychologist Michael Giambona
provides individual therapy sessions to his middle school students
during the school day.

Giambona also routinely runs interference with kids’ teachers on kids’
behalf. “My teachers have special training in working with individuals
with behavior needs and mental health needs,” he told me. “And we meet
weekly, and we talk about what’s going on with each student and how we
can approach them and support them when they need it.”

There’s a problem with in-school therapy, an ethical compromise, which
arguably corrupts its very heart. In a remarkably underregulated
profession, therapists still have a few ethical bright lines. And among
the clearest is—or was—the prohibition on “dual relationships.”

“The relationship in the therapy room needs to be its own, distinct and
apart,” psychologist and author Lori Gottlieb explains in her book,
[Maybe You Should Talk to
Someone](https://annas-archive.org/search?q=Lori+Gottlieb+Maybe+You+Should+Talk+to+Someone).
“To avoid an ethical breach known as a dual relationship, I can’t treat
or receive treatment from any person in my orbit—not a parent of a kid
in my son’s class, not the sister of coworkers, not a friend’s mom, not
my neighbor.” This ethical guardrail exists to protect a patient from
exploitation. A patient may reveal her deepest secrets and
vulnerabilities to her therapist, who could then rule over her like a
czarina does her kulaks. Anyone possessing this much knowledge of a
patient’s private life may be tempted to exert undue power. And so the
profession makes “dual relationships” off limits.

Except that school counselors, school psychologists, and social workers
enjoy a dual relationship with every kid who comes to see them. They
know all of a kid’s best friends; they may even treat a few of them with
therapy. They know a kid’s parents and their friends’ parents. They know
the boy a girl has a crush on, what romantically transpired between
them, and how the relationship ended. They know a kid’s teammates and
coaches and the teacher who’s giving him a hard time. And they report,
not to a kid’s parents, but to the school administration. It’s a wonder
we allow these in-school relationships at all.

The American Counseling Association appears to have noticed the obvious
problem. In 2006, it revised the ACA Code of Ethics. While still
prohibiting sexual relationships with current clients, it decided that
“nonsexual” dual relationships were no longer prohibited—especially
those that “could be beneficial to the client.”

As school counselors and psychologists came to see themselves as
students’ “advocates,” they slipped into a dual relationship with their
students: part therapist; part academic intermediary; part parenting
coach. Today, school counselors and psychologists commonly evaluate,
diagnose, and treat students with individual therapy; meet with their
friends; intervene with their teachers; and pass them in the lunchroom.
A teen who has just spent a tear-soaked hour telling the school
counselor her deepest secrets might reasonably be fearful of upsetting
anyone with that much power over her life.

But are school counselors and social workers exerting undue influence
over kids?

Over the past two years, I have been so inundated with parents’ stories
of school counselors encouraging a child to try on a variant gender
identity, even changing the child’s name without telling the parents,
that I’ve almost wondered if there are any good school counselors. One
parent I interviewed told me that her son’s high school counselor had
given him the address of a local LGBTQ youth shelter where he might seek
asylum and attempt to legally liberate himself from loving parents.

There are good school counselors; I have interviewed several. But the
power structure’s all wrong. Grant a leader the powers of a monarch, and
he may gift his subjects freedom—but what’s to tether him to his
promises? That’s placing a whole lot of trust in an individual
counselor’s conscience.

You might respond at this point: fortunately, my child has never been to
see the school counselor. But more likely, you don’t know. In
California, Illinois, Washington, Colorado, Florida, and Maryland,
minors twelve or thirteen and up are statutorily entitled to access
mental health care without parental permission. Schools are not only
under no obligation to inform parents that their kids are meeting
regularly with a school counselor, they may even be barred from doing
so.

As long as a parent has not specifically forbidden it, a school
counselor may be able to conduct a therapy session with a minor child
without parental consent. School counselors are encouraged to make
“judgment calls” about what information, gleaned in sessions with minor
children, they may keep secret from the children’s parents.

### School Staff Who Play Therapist

Ever since her school adopted social-emotional learning in 2021, Ms.
Julie routinely began the day by directing her Salt Lake City fifth
graders to sit in one of the plastic chairs she’d arranged in a circle.
“How is each of you feeling this morning?” she would ask, performing a
more intensive version of the “emotions check-in.” One day, she cut to
the chase: “What is something that is making you really sad right now?”

When it was his turn to speak, one boy began mumbling about his father’s
new girlfriend. Then things fell apart. “All of a sudden, he just
started bawling. And he was like, ‘I think that my dad hates me. And he
yells at me all the time,’ ” said Laura, a mom of one of the other
students.

Another girl announced that her parents had divorced and burst into
tears. Another said she was worried about the man her mother was dating.
Within minutes, half of the kids were sobbing. It was time for the math
lesson, but no one wanted to do it. It was just so sad, thinking that
the boy’s dad hated him. What if their dads hated them, too?

“It just kind of set the tone for the rest of the day,” Laura said.
“Everyone just was feeling really sad and down for a really long time.
It was hard for them to kind of come out of that.”

A second mom at the school confirmed to me that word spread throughout
the school about the AA meeting–style breakdown. Except this AA meeting
featured elementary school kids who then ran to tell their friends what
everyone else had shared.

Thanks to social-emotional learning, scenes of emotional melee have
become increasingly common in American classrooms. In 2013, The New York
Times reported on a near identical scene that took place after a
California teacher conducted a similar social-emotional learning session
with his kindergarteners. “With children especially, whatever you focus
on is what will grow,” Laura said. “And I feel like with
\[social-emotional learning\], they’re watering the weeds, instead of
watering the flowers.”

Advocates of social-emotional learning claim that nearly all kids today
have suffered serious traumatic experiences that leave them unable to
learn. They also insist that having an educator host a class-wide trauma
swap before lunch will help such kids heal. Neither claim is
well-founded.

But the predictable result is precisely what Ms. Julie saw: otherwise
happy kids are brought low and a child seriously struggling has his
private pain publicly exposed by someone in no position to remedy it.

Sometimes when a kid plunks himself down on the rug for morning circle,
he is in no mood to exhibit a painful experience no matter how much it
might expand the class’s emotional horizons. This leaves
teacher-therapists with a problem: How to get kids to dish about their
emotional lives when they really don’t want to?

One presenter at the conference, Amelia Azzam, a regional mental health
coordinator for Orange County Public Schools, told a story that seemed
to answer this quandary. She knew of a teaching assistant who trailed a
seventh grader to lunch. She “goes out to lunch where this young student
sits, and she always says ‘hi’ to him. And she has casual interactions
with him.” And one day, he told her that his dad was getting out of
jail.

“Nobody else knew that,” Azzam said.

Good therapists know that it may be counterproductive to push a kid to
share his trauma at school. Good therapists are trained specifically to
avoid encouraging rumination, a thought process typified by dwelling on
past pain and negative emotions. Rumination is a well-established risk
factor for depression. But school staff who play therapist rarely seem
aware that they might be encouraging rumination as they stalk a kid at
lunch, waiting to see if he’ll open up about his father’s incarceration
minutes before a history test.

### Injecting Anxiety into Math Class

Social-emotional learning enthusiasts happily disrupt math or English or
history because, to the true believers, education is merely a vehicle
for their social-emotional lessons—the corn chip that carries the guac
straight to a kid’s mouth. “I can’t think of a content area that needs
more social-emotional learning than mathematics,” educational consultant
Ricky Robertson told our assembled conference room.

But how would a teacher manage to make social-emotional learning the
goal of a math class? To discover the answer, I sat through a
presentation titled “Embedding SEL in Math.”

Our mock lesson commenced with—you guessed it—discussion of our feelings
about math. “Anxiety!” more than one teacher volunteered. The presenters
showed us a series of kindergarten-level “math problems” that asked us
to look at a bunch of shapes and asked: “Which one doesn’t belong?”

At the end, they revealed the correct answer: they all belong. No wrong
answers! Everyone wins! See, that wasn’t hard.

I turned to the high school math teacher next to me and asked her how
she could possibly incorporate this sort of approach into Algebra II.
She stared back at me, a frozen rictus pinned to the corners of her
mouth. She seemed to think Big Brother was watching us.

The only feeling apparently never affirmed in social-emotional learning
is mistrust of emotional conversation in place of learning. A decent
number of kids actually show up hoping to learn some geometry and not
burn their limited instructional time on conversations about their
mental health. But from every angle, such children could only be made to
feel errant and alone.

In the minds of social-emotional learning advocates, healthy kids are
those who share their pain during geometry. That is how a teacher knows
they are emotionally regulated. They are willing to cry for the benefit
of the class.

Well yeah okay this is technically true since going to a government
school where you are trained by communists to be an annoying jackass is
probably pretty traumatic.

The economic incentives that take root, once these therapies are built
into “medicine”, are impossible to tear out. They grow and envelop the
society, and an entire class of medical practitioners’ livelihoods
depend on its support and further growth. That means more “patients”
will be pulled into the maw. If your career depends on growing your
practice to feed your family, you WILL find more people to diagnose,
treat, put on medication, and further entrench in the therapy mindset
that will overwhelm our society.

This essay isn’t about “ medicine”. These are the lowest level hacks , “

revolution for a power grab.

<blockquote>

Yes, and.

Once a “disorder” is in the DSM-V, it enters an ecosystem with referral
points, therapists, and ultimately medication. I support your belief
that it is Maoist/Marxist in effect, but it is tangled up in our
decadence as a culture.

Putin and Xi can sit back and watch the show, and that extends far
beyond this conversation on therapy culture. It is how we roll as a
people.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<blockquote>

The DSM is a billing manual and a political treatise,having nothing to
do with patient care. For example, they removed the word disorder from
the diagnosis of gender dysphoria for political doctrine reasons. GD is
as much a psychological problem as is anorexia nervosa, but the Trans
cult and DEI has control over psychiatry and medical training in
general.

Psychiatry is the least evidence based field in medicine and always has
been.They do less and less “ talk” therapy and largely push pills and
ECT the brain with no data to support their claims of safety and
efficacy. It’s rotten , powerful, and stigmatizing

I don’t believe kids should be happy 100% of the time; they need to fail
a test, get cut from a team and have fights with friend groups; this is
when they acquire some resilience and once they get through it, they
will recognize how to navigate through life’s hiccups and that is what
will make them truly happy and confident adults.

This is a tough one for me. I entered teaching (HS lit) as a career
change at age 48 in 2005, and taught for 14 years until retirement. I
saw the whole phone/social media thing unfold right in my classroom.

On one hand I saw the normal trials of the teen ... good moods, bad
moods, sad moods, mad moods. A girl might enter my class having been
heartbroken by a boy, or a boy might come in with an attitude for
whatever reason.

When should I intervene? If so, how? Or should I let it go and let the
natural forces of emotional control take over? You know ... growing up.

Mostly, I was hands-off. Let emotional growth take its normal path. But
at the same time, students sometimes revealed their most deepest darkest
secrets in personal essays ... I read about abuse at home, divorce and
custody issues, alcoholism (parents), parents in jail, neglect,
homelessness, even abortion. What to do?

Phones and social media complicated things. Suddenly I was competing for
their most precious asset ... attention ... and for many students I was
losing it to the brainiacs in Silicon Valley. What to do?

It's easy to bang on teachers for stepping out of their lanes. But I get
it, even though I grew up in a whole different time where the natural
process of emotional growth took its course.

I lean strongly against "risk-aversion" and overprotection in child
development. And I see Ms. Shrier's points as valid. Still ... what to
do?

The more you convince young people that they are victims suffering from

When parents, en masse, begin removing their children from public
schools things will change. It's also about the money; fewer students,
less money for the schools. We need more low cost private schools. They
don't need football, baseball, basketball, tennis, track teams. Those
activities can be experienced by the students on their own. Just provide
the facilties. Up until and through the 6th grade we all played sports
and we organized them ourselves. In Jr. high, (middle school) sports
became organized and that eliminated those who weren't the best and they
had nowhere to play. Begining in the 7th grade we could learn a musical
instrument, learn to sing, play piano and learn to draw. That's all gone
now and those who can't afford private lessons are left out. We all had
friends that we could talk too about what was going on in our lives. It
wasn't therapy, but it let off the steam. If your child is in one of the
types of schools that the author talked about, if you can, get them out.
It's it's interesting to compare education in the US with education in
Thailand. In Thailand, though not the best, you can still get an
education. Graduating students can read, write, do math and have
excellent memories. The family is still the basis of the culture, and
most young people still live at home, even when they have jobs. It's not
unusual for grandparents, parents, and children to live together. In the
US the family is not longer the center of the culture and we can see the
damage that has come from that.

plumbing and wiring, and then putting up the sheet rock. That was

This seems like a microcosm of Progressivism generally. They start with
some obviously-silly idea that nevertheless has a certain emotional

blindly, and no supporting evidence is even sought. Soon it's vigorously
imposed on everyone, because although people may not realize it, this is
important, it's a crisis, if we don't do something now, a disaster is
looming. The required solution requires the hiring of large numbers of
Progressives, who are then granted ever more control over peoples'
lives.

The program of course turns out to be a disaster, and usually ends up
creating the very problem that it was nominally supposed to be
addressing. The Progressives then point to this and say, see, look how
bad the problem is, we told you so but you wouldn't listen, this shows
how much we are needed. It is imperative that we do even more of it. And
then the Progressives get to feel morally superior to everyone else
because of all of the carnage they created.

We are seeing much evil that is deliberate. I get hysterics when I use
the word evil, as if I'm advocating chasing down and harming people. But
evil people are all around us and function in society as long as the
majority keep them in check. The 1930's Germans and the 1990's Rwandans,
among others, didn't keep them in check, jumped on the herd bandwagon
and the rest is history. I've also been accused of "advocating violence"
when I say that if my children were young today, I would do whatever is
necessary to protect them from the evil oozing in society. I would say
I'm preventing violence against my children. It's easy, keep the hands
off my kids and if some evil sack can't stop, I will stop it. I do give
warning shots. We tend to not know how to deal with the slow drip until
it's too late. If I say that if I saw a stranger was trying to drag a
child down the street and into a car, I would tackle the stranger, is
that advocating violence? Obviously not. We have to stop the slow drip
drawing children into a woodchipper.

Isn't the bald truth that state schools are now beyond repair. "America
has seen a sharp growth of parent anger and activist pushback against
instances of classroom indoctrination - sometimes even at kindergarten
age. The trigger was how covid pandemic lockdowns heightened parental
awareness of the school curriculum. Opeds like this one are not
uncommon: “When schools went remote, parents found out what was actually
going on inside the classrooms. Teachers were coaching students to hate
themselves, their country and their religious traditions and sexualizing
young children.” ......

That vast infrastructure of buildings full of classrooms children and
teachers. Kids spending their weekdays being taught by teachers – how
could things possibly be otherwise? In this essay I try, firstly, to
sketch an impressionistic snapshot of this ‘Schools in Crisis’ media
flurry and then to dip a toe into the hazy waters of what could possibly
replace them as the means by which society teaches its children."

## DNA crime labs exposed as complete frauds - used by government to convict innocent people in the name of "science"

by Mike Adams

Today we have two bombshell stories to share with you. First, the WSJ
has blown the whistle on DNA crime labs now being exposed as total
frauds. Used by police and governments to convict innocent people, these
crime labs altered DNA data to generate "guilty" verdicts.

The entire field of PCR-based DNA testing is a total fraud, as is much
of the field of virology. "Expert" witnesses try to bamboozle people
with confusing-sounding science, but it all falls apart at the slightest
bit of scrutiny.

## Social Media As We Know It Is Dead

Authenticity in today’s world has become a rare commodity.

The advent of AI and its ability to replicate human behavior in
text-based conversations, posts, and comments has led to an **influx of
inauthentic content** and interactions. The line between AI and human
engagement has blurred, leaving **users struggling to distinguish
between genuine human interaction and AI-generated content**.

Social media as we have always known it is dead. Platforms like X
\[Twitter\] have been **plagued by AI bots** for years, **flooding**
feeds with images of celebrities and other content that is not only
inauthentic but also **misleading**. A quick scroll through your
Facebook feed will yield dozens of AI generated posts that are loaded
with comments of people who are seemingly unaware that they are viewing
an AI image. Instagram is no different.

This phenomenon poses a real threat to the social media landscape,
forcing users to question the legitimacy of the connections they form
online. As **AI continues to advance and infiltrate social media
platforms**, there is a growing need for authentic communities of real
people.

The **best solution to this problem is the implementation of a paywall**
on social media platforms, which is exactly what Gab and several other
platforms are doing. While it is **not a foolproof method**, it can be
an effective way to ensure that users interacting on a platform are, in
fact, real people. By requiring a financial commitment from users,
platforms can create an environment that fosters genuine connections and
interactions. It also **significantly raises the cost of bot operators
conducting spam and psychological operations** with AI, which will
greatly reduce their attack surface and effectiveness.

Elon Musk’s plan to charge new users
1*o**n**h**i**s**s**o**c**i**a**l**m**e**d**i**a**p**l**a**t**f**o**r**m**X*\[*T**w**i**t**t**e**r*\]*a**i**m**s**t**o**c**o**m**b**a**t**a**u**t**o**m**a**t**e**d**s**p**a**m**b**o**t**a**c**c**o**u**n**t**s*.*T**h**i**s**i**n**i**t**i**a**t**i**v**e**r**e**q**u**i**r**e**s**n**e**w**u**s**e**r**s**i**n**c**o**u**n**t**r**i**e**s**l**i**k**e**N**e**w**Z**e**a**l**a**n**d**a**n**d**t**h**e**P**h**i**l**i**p**p**i**n**e**s**t**o**p**a**y**a* \* \*<!-- -->1
annual fee\*\* to unlock basic features like posting and interacting
with other users. Musk believes that this fee is essential to **make it
significantly harder for bots to manipulate the platform** while
maintaining accessibility for real users. The move is part of Musk’s
broader strategy to revamp X \[Twitter\] as a subscription-focused
platform.

Telegram also offers a subscription service called Telegram Premium,
which allows users to support the platform’s development and access
exclusive additional features. Telegram Premium provides benefits like
doubled **limits**, 4 GB file uploads, faster downloads, exclusive
stickers, and reactions. This subscription model aims to fund the
development of resource-heavy features while ensuring free access to the
core messenger service for all users.

Gab is taking a similar approach with our [GabPRO subscription
service](https://pro.gab.com/) which unlocks the ability to upload
media, schedule posts, and get access to analytics on your posts among
other features. Another perk is that when you see a GabPRO account you
know it’s a real human being and not AI.

A few months back we experimented with AI profiles on the Gab platform.
The overwhelming feedback from our community was that they wanted to
interact with other people, not AI on social media. So we listened to
the Gab community and moved the AI bots to their own dedicated platform
called Gab AI. We agree with the Gab Social community that our platform
should be reserved for real people.

As users become more aware of the prevalence of AI on these platforms,
the demand for real, human-to-human connections will only grow. The
implementation of a paywall for parts of social networks is the first
step in preserving the integrity of social media and ensuring that users
have the ability to engage with one another in an authentic and
meaningful way. If you're interested in joining a social network of real
human beings we invite you to get on Gab and [upgrade to
GabPRO](https://pro.gab.com/).

I discussed all of this and more in today’s podcast episode which [you
can listen to here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2276284/14644048).

## Oregon unleashes small farm wipeout, making it a crime to irrigate crops or raise animals

The State of Oregon is at war with small, local farms and is issuing
cease-and-desist letters to destroy small-scale farming across the
state.

It's all part of the war against decentralized food production, so that
famine can be weaponized against the people to enslave and terrorize
them.

We have full, shocking details in today's Brighteon Broadcast News, plus
a hard-hitting new emergency interview with Steve Quayle about the
destruction of America.

## Potential false flag dirty bomb attack on US military base in Europe, to be blamed on Russia or Iran.

1:07:07

Now, speaking of the military, this is actually...  
I should get serious here for a minute.  
Sorry, I get too loosey goosey with some of this stuff  
because I just can't stop  
mocking the insanity of the governments around us.

But here's a tweet from Nick Sortor.

The threat level at us military bases in Germany,  
Italy, Romania and Bulgaria have been raised to Charlie,  
which means, quote, an imminent threat of terrorism.  
This is the highest threat level in at least ten years.

And let me show you this chart of threat levels.  
So you can see.

All right, so as you can see from the bottom of this chart,  
the green status is normal. No known enemy or threat.

Alpha is possible threat of terrorist activity.  
That's condition blue.

Bravo is yellow, and it's  
increased and predictable threat of terrorism.

Charlie is the imminent threat of terrorism.

And there's one more level here called Charley Horse.  
That's also a very painful cramp experience  
when anticipating an imminent threat of terrorism.  
For some reason, they left that off this chart.  
Charlie Horse is one of the worst.  
You can't fight when you have Charlie Horse.

And then there's delta, which is red, and that's  
localized specific terrorist threat or attack.

And as you can see, this is sort of alphabetical,  
except for normal, the green one.  
So other than that, it's ABCD. Got it?

So apparently we are now in  
condition Charlie in these countries.  
Germany, Italy, Romania and Bulgaria.  
And this means that the US bases in these countries  
are anticipating an imminent attack.

Now, of course, they say "terrorism".  
What they mean by terrorism is basically just incoming enemy fire.  
Okay, it's called war.  
But, you know, the US just calls everything terrorism,  
except when the US is attacking and bombing other countries, that's
called "war".  
But when those countries are attacking us, that's called terrorism.  
Just so you're familiar with the terminology,

But we are apparently under condition Charlie.  
Now, this tells me something as an analyst  
who has 20 years \[experience\] in alternative media,  
actually more than 20 years at this point.  
Here's what's actually going to happen.

NATO forces are preparing \[to execute\]  
a massive false flag attack on a US military base in western Europe.  
This attack will likely consist of a radiological component, probably a
dirty bomb,  
or some kind of a drone attack with a dirty bomb payload.  
The most likely scenario is, in fact, exactly that.  
It's a drone with a dirty bomb payload  
combined with a kinetic explosive weapon  
to disperse the radioactive dirty bomb material,  
and that this drone would fly over a US military base  
and it would detonate it at some altitude  
in order to achieve widespread dispersal,  
rendering the base uninhabitable  
because of the radioactive contamination, obviously.

This will be blamed on either Russia or Iran.  
Most likely, if this happens in western Europe, it'll be blamed on
Russia.  
If it happens anywhere else, from Turkey on down, anywhere close to the
Middle east,  
then it's going to be blamed on Iran. I have no doubt.

In fact, I have predicted that this would happen,  
that there would be a false flag attack on american assets, military
assets,  
in order to initiate an escalation into world war three  
and to be able to blame it on Russia  
so that the west can invoke article five.

So again, article five.  
This is the agreement among NATO nations that says  
if one of them is "attacked",  
that the other NATO nations then have the option,  
not the requirement, but the option,  
to engage in a mutual military "defense" against the aggressor.

And so the west is trying to invoke article  
five and then they're trying to demand that the  
UK, France and Germany and, well, even Turkey,  
they're trying to demand  
that all these NATO countries get in with the war  
and send troops to fight  
Russia, which Turkey has, says we won't do.

Turkey is probably going to be busy  
fighting Israel sooner or later here, by the way.

If Israel attacks Lebanon, which also seems imminent,  
Turkey is probably going to bail out of NATO.  
This is my prediction.  
Turkey will quit NATO, Turkey will join BRICS.  
Turkey will send troops to join Hezbollah  
in working to defeat Israel.  
And this will open up the entire southern flank of NATO,  
which Turkey currently occupies.

And this is significant given that Turkey  
has the largest land military force in  
all of NATO in western Europe.
