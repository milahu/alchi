## Gab Stands Up to Censorship Requests from Europol

Dear Gab users,

We want to bring your attention to a recent development that highlights
the importance of our ongoing commitment to free speech and our
dedication to protecting your rights on our platform.

This morning, Europol, a European Union law enforcement agency, [reached
out to Gab, demanding that we censor
links](https://gab.com/a/posts/111799850135725666) to a documentary
called [Europa The Last
Battle](https://solidtorrents.to/search?q=europa+the+last+battle).
Europol claims that the documentary violates their laws and should be
removed from our platform.

For those unfamiliar, Europol is a European Union agency responsible for
coordinating the sharing of information and intelligence between law
enforcement agencies across 27 EU member states. While Europol may have
a significant role in maintaining law and order within the European
Union, we must remain vigilant in ensuring that their requests do not
infringe upon our users' rights to free speech and expression.

As a platform that values and upholds the principles of free speech, we
will not be removing the documentary from Gab. We believe that the First
Amendment protects the rights of our users to share and access
information, even if it may be considered controversial by some.

We have chosen to stand up to Europol's censorship request. These
decisions to stand up to foreign government requests incur a significant
amount of legal costs to handle these situations. However, we believe
that this is a worthy investment to ensure that free speech is protected
from censorship by foreign governments.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our users who have
supported us in our mission to provide a platform that respects and
protects free speech. We encourage you to continue standing with us as
we navigate these challenges together.

If you believe in our cause and would like to support our efforts to
maintain a free and open platform, please consider upgrading to GabPRO,
making a one-time donation or purchase from our shop, or running ads for
your business or brand on Gab.

Thank you for your continued support and for helping us keep the spirit
of free speech alive.

Sincerely,

The Gab Team

Europol just emailed us and demanded that we remove a post someone made
on Gab sharing a link to the documentary Europa The Last Battle. Not
only will we not be removing it, but I’ll also share the link here and
encourage you to watch the documentary that the EU cronies are terrified
of you watching.

<blockquote>

In our assessment, the content referred incites to hatred by either
threatening, taunting, offending a targeted group and it involves, but
might not be limited to, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, homophobia,
or other forms of discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ collective.

\[The content violates Article 1 of the [EU Council Framework Decision
2008/913/JHA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008F0913)
of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms of expressions of racism
and xenophobia by means of criminal law\]

We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Kind regards

At least they are open about their Marxist goals.

get fucked eurokikes

zionst centuries rule over EU nothing strange about this letter.whats
worst is dumb Europeans who forget own history,and aceppting khszarians.

Excellent post, very good film that exposes some of the hidden history
from WW2. Censorship sucks. I'm glad you are not honoring there request.
Gab might be the last real FREE SPEECH site on the internet.

272 politicians of European Parliament were on (((György Soros)))
payroll -it was revealed in a leak but this information has been erased
from the Internet.  
-"Last year, too, it was revealed that 22 of the 100 permanent judges of
the ECJ had ties with organisations linked to Soros."

Evil people are bothered by a documentary spreading the truth.  
Because with the Jewish lies deunked they no longer can market their
satanic supremacy as "good side of the history".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The power that be are pissing their plants in fear that the masses are
waking up! But a 12+ hour video requires a lot of stamina to get through
it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EU along with any other Globalist operation has gotta get it through
their thick heads that no one has the authority to control the free-flow
of information, ideas, thoughts and opinions.

Fuck ‘em

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The truth is a “threat” to their Jewish supremacy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great movie.

I think I will watch it a third time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why these people think that if you have refused 1000
censorship requests you will suddenly respond to 1001. Does Europol
think it is somehow special in comparison to various national
governments?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

... and these people still have the audacity to call themselves "anti"
fascists

we (males of the old population) are expected to shut up and keep
working and keep paying taxes, while our countries are invaded by
african males, financed by our tax money

this censorship is an overreach, because the contents per se are not
illegal, but they claim: these contents are a danger to the public
peace. makes sense, because if too many people "wake up", they will
revolt

so this censorship is their way to prevent a bottom-up revolution
("insurrection"), and to protect their top-down revolution, to stay in
control. no surprise, fascists are control freaks

reminds me of The Pirate Bay, who have published some of the legal
threats against them

Legal threats against The Pirate Bay

Article 1 of the EU Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA

> Racism and xenophobia are direct violations of the principles of

so we are enemies of: liberalism, democracy, humanism, legalism

this should cost zero, otherwise they will use this trolling to steal
your money

## BMJ Report Recommends “Behavioral Interventions” To “Reduce Vaccine Hesitancy Driven by Misinformation on Social Media”

These interventions include boosting the visibility of "reliable health
information" and social media companies becoming "more proactive in
dealing with the proliferation of misinformation on their sites."

[By Didi Rankovic](https://reclaimthenet.org/author/dee-rankovic)

The BMJ is not short for “Behavioral Medical Journal” – but it might as
well be.

Now this publication, owned by the British Medical Association, is
exploring how to deploy no less than “behavioral interventions” to bring
about less “vaccine hesitancy.”

And [the article](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076542)
doesn’t stop at medical arguments. The hesitancy here is specifically
linked with social media driven “misinformation.”

The recommendations don’t differ greatly from what those Big Tech social
subsidiaries have been including for years in their policies – and these
“guidelines” were probably cooked in the same kitchen, so to speak.

Things like, boosting the visibility of “reliable health information”
and more “pro-action” on these platforms “in dealing with the
proliferation of misinformation.”

First, the authors of the piece seek to define the way in which social
media affects vaccination campaigns. The take is basically entirely
negative – asserting that this effect amounts to misinformation only.

Paying lip service to genuine safety concerns playing a role in low
uptake, the BMJ instantly switches back to playing up the danger of
hesitancy.

Thus – there’s been a “return of measles” as of late. And, the
implication is, the World Health Organization (WHO) used that among
other things to issue an extreme “decree” to the world – that vaccine
hesitancy is “among the greatest threats to global health,” WHO said.

And while the article positions the concern about vaccination in general
– including decades-long used and tested ones – the highly controversial
Covid jab eventually makes an appearance.

And it is mentioned as that point where this general “hesitancy” gained
momentum, with the social media – rather than the sketchy nature of
these particular vaccines – to blame.

Now for the “solutions,” specifically those based on behavioral
interventions methods, or let’s say, “reprogramming.”

Here’s what BMJ says are standard behavioral approaches: encouraging
vaccination by “(including) mandatory vaccination and regulation for
healthcare professionals, incentives, public health communication
campaigns, and engaging trusted leaders.”

Don’t feel bad if the term “orchestrated campaign” occurs to you as you
read the BMJ mentioning “pre-bunking” information as one way to deal
with this problem of its own making. “Pre-bunking” enthusiasts are now
cropping up all over the place.

And there’s more ways to inoculate people than just against viruses –
there’s also manipulative “inoculation” against broad-minded
consideration of all available information.

The BMJ says: “Other intervention types include warning (‘inoculating’)
people about manipulation tactics using non-harmful exposure as a tool
to identify misinformation, and using accuracy prompts to trigger people
to consider the truthfulness of material they are about to share on
social media platforms, without stopping them from posting.”

## Treasonous SCOTUS orders full-scale migrant invasion of America in final act of national suicide

The U.S. Supreme Court just ordered Texas to allow the full-scale
migrant invasion that's overrunning America, ruling that any defensive
barriers are illegal.

Is this how the civil war begins? Texas is adamant that its borders must
be protected against invasion. In fact, the U.S. Constitution demands
that the federal government protect states from invasion, yet SCOTUS is
acting in a way that is thoroughly complicit in an active, wartime
invasion and occupation of the United States of America.

The intention is clear: To overrun America, exterminate all Americans
and replace them with imported illegals who have no ties to the
Constitution or American culture.

Plus today, we feature an interview with David Webb of "The Great
Taking" who describes how the engineered mass theft of your financial
assets has been carefully planned and is about to be activated.
