## Gab Stands Up to Censorship Requests from Europol

Dear Gab users,

We want to bring your attention to a recent development that highlights
the importance of our ongoing commitment to free speech and our
dedication to protecting your rights on our platform.

This morning, Europol, a European Union law enforcement agency, [reached
out to Gab, demanding that we censor
links](https://gab.com/a/posts/111799850135725666) to a documentary
called [Europa The Last
Battle](https://solidtorrents.to/search?q=europa+the+last+battle).
Europol claims that the documentary violates their laws and should be
removed from our platform.

For those unfamiliar, Europol is a European Union agency responsible for
coordinating the sharing of information and intelligence between law
enforcement agencies across 27 EU member states. While Europol may have
a significant role in maintaining law and order within the European
Union, we must remain vigilant in ensuring that their requests do not
infringe upon our users' rights to free speech and expression.

As a platform that values and upholds the principles of free speech, we
will not be removing the documentary from Gab. We believe that the First
Amendment protects the rights of our users to share and access
information, even if it may be considered controversial by some.

We have chosen to stand up to Europol's censorship request. These
decisions to stand up to foreign government requests incur a significant
amount of legal costs to handle these situations. However, we believe
that this is a worthy investment to ensure that free speech is protected
from censorship by foreign governments.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our users who have
supported us in our mission to provide a platform that respects and
protects free speech. We encourage you to continue standing with us as
we navigate these challenges together.

If you believe in our cause and would like to support our efforts to
maintain a free and open platform, please consider upgrading to GabPRO,
making a one-time donation or purchase from our shop, or running ads for
your business or brand on Gab.

Thank you for your continued support and for helping us keep the spirit
of free speech alive.

Sincerely,

The Gab Team

Europol just emailed us and demanded that we remove a post someone made
on Gab sharing a link to the documentary Europa The Last Battle. Not
only will we not be removing it, but I’ll also share the link here and
encourage you to watch the documentary that the EU cronies are terrified
of you watching.

<blockquote>

In our assessment, the content referred incites to hatred by either
threatening, taunting, offending a targeted group and it involves, but
might not be limited to, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, homophobia,
or other forms of discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ collective.

\[The content violates Article 1 of the [EU Council Framework Decision
2008/913/JHA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008F0913)
of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms of expressions of racism
and xenophobia by means of criminal law\]

We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Kind regards

Evil people are bothered by a documentary spreading the truth.  
Because with the Jewish lies deunked they no longer can market their
satanic supremacy as "good side of the history".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The power that be are pissing their plants in fear that the masses are
waking up! But a 12+ hour video requires a lot of stamina to get through
it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EU along with any other Globalist operation has gotta get it through
their thick heads that no one has the authority to control the free-flow
of information, ideas, thoughts and opinions.

Fuck ‘em

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The truth is a “threat” to their Jewish supremacy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great movie.

I think I will watch it a third time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why these people think that if you have refused 1000
censorship requests you will suddenly respond to 1001. Does Europol
think it is somehow special in comparison to various national
governments?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

... and these people still have the audacity to call themselves "anti"
fascists

we (males of the old population) are expected to shut up and keep
working and keep paying taxes, while our countries are invaded by
african males, financed by our tax money

this censorship is an overreach, because the contents per se are not
illegal, but they claim: these contents are a danger to the public
peace. makes sense, because if too many people "wake up", they will
revolt

so this censorship is their way to prevent a bottom-up revolution
("insurrection"), and to protect their top-down revolution, to stay in
control. no surprise, fascists are control freaks

## BMJ Report Recommends “Behavioral Interventions” To “Reduce Vaccine Hesitancy Driven by Misinformation on Social Media”

These interventions include boosting the visibility of "reliable health
information" and social media companies becoming "more proactive in
dealing with the proliferation of misinformation on their sites."

[By Didi Rankovic](https://reclaimthenet.org/author/dee-rankovic)

The BMJ is not short for “Behavioral Medical Journal” – but it might as
well be.

Now this publication, owned by the British Medical Association, is
exploring how to deploy no less than “behavioral interventions” to bring
about less “vaccine hesitancy.”

And [the article](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076542)
doesn’t stop at medical arguments. The hesitancy here is specifically
linked with social media driven “misinformation.”

The recommendations don’t differ greatly from what those Big Tech social
subsidiaries have been including for years in their policies – and these
“guidelines” were probably cooked in the same kitchen, so to speak.

Things like, boosting the visibility of “reliable health information”
and more “pro-action” on these platforms “in dealing with the
proliferation of misinformation.”

First, the authors of the piece seek to define the way in which social
media affects vaccination campaigns. The take is basically entirely
negative – asserting that this effect amounts to misinformation only.

Paying lip service to genuine safety concerns playing a role in low
uptake, the BMJ instantly switches back to playing up the danger of
hesitancy.

Thus – there’s been a “return of measles” as of late. And, the
implication is, the World Health Organization (WHO) used that among
other things to issue an extreme “decree” to the world – that vaccine
hesitancy is “among the greatest threats to global health,” WHO said.

And while the article positions the concern about vaccination in general
– including decades-long used and tested ones – the highly controversial
Covid jab eventually makes an appearance.

And it is mentioned as that point where this general “hesitancy” gained
momentum, with the social media – rather than the sketchy nature of
these particular vaccines – to blame.

Now for the “solutions,” specifically those based on behavioral
interventions methods, or let’s say, “reprogramming.”

Here’s what BMJ says are standard behavioral approaches: encouraging
vaccination by “(including) mandatory vaccination and regulation for
healthcare professionals, incentives, public health communication
campaigns, and engaging trusted leaders.”

Don’t feel bad if the term “orchestrated campaign” occurs to you as you
read the BMJ mentioning “pre-bunking” information as one way to deal
with this problem of its own making. “Pre-bunking” enthusiasts are now
cropping up all over the place.

And there’s more ways to inoculate people than just against viruses –
there’s also manipulative “inoculation” against broad-minded
consideration of all available information.

The BMJ says: “Other intervention types include warning (‘inoculating’)
people about manipulation tactics using non-harmful exposure as a tool
to identify misinformation, and using accuracy prompts to trigger people
to consider the truthfulness of material they are about to share on
social media platforms, without stopping them from posting.”

## Treasonous SCOTUS orders full-scale migrant invasion of America in final act of national suicide

The U.S. Supreme Court just ordered Texas to allow the full-scale
migrant invasion that's overrunning America, ruling that any defensive
barriers are illegal.

Is this how the civil war begins? Texas is adamant that its borders must
be protected against invasion. In fact, the U.S. Constitution demands
that the federal government protect states from invasion, yet SCOTUS is
acting in a way that is thoroughly complicit in an active, wartime
invasion and occupation of the United States of America.

The intention is clear: To overrun America, exterminate all Americans
and replace them with imported illegals who have no ties to the
Constitution or American culture.

## Trump wins again, crypto and gold beat counterfeit currency

Trump just clobbered Nikki Haley in New Hampshire and the GOP nomination
is all but wrapped up now. It's Trump vs. whoever the Democrats decide
to run, and a lot of people think that's going to be "Big Mike."

Today we also cover the superiority of private crypto and gold as
systems that store value. They are valuable because governments cannot
counterfeit them, and confiscation is also nearly impossible for
governments to achieve.

Remember: **Governments don't want you to use any system of money that
they can't surveil, confiscate and counterfeit. That's why they oppose

Mike, **why do you continue to push Trump propaganda non-stop just like
Alex Jones?**

While in office, Trump:

1.  Took credit for and promoted Warp Speed even though publicly
    available studies exposed how every animal injected with **mRNA**
    DIED!!
2.  STILL **brags about and promotes those shots** even though a
    MOUNTAIN of studies, statistics and testimonials PROVE how deadly
    they are.
3.  He approved the final installation of **deadly 5G towers on every
    street corner** even though DECADES of studies and expert testimony
    reveal how harmful it is, especially to children.
4.  **He signed Int'l agreements and EO's that give a future President
    and/or FOREIGN entities i.e. UN/WHO, the immediate power to remove
    what few God given rights we have left if an 'emergency' is
    declared.**
5.  **He ignored Assange** being incarcerated AND tortured for simply
    receiving and publicly posting evidence of actions taken by evil,
    corrupt segments of the US gov't.

**While he did say a lot of things that we liked hearing, everything he
did supported and forwarded the Rothschild (formerly the Bauer
family)/Rockefeller agenda against humanity. This is NOT a
coincidence.**

I won't even go into Trumps length friendship with Epstein (who still
lives); how he announced "lock her up" referring to Killary, but then
publicly stated that the Clintons were "good people"; or his lengthy
collaboration with both the Rothschild and Rockefeller banks.

Trump is and always has been a Rothschild/Rockefeller puppet. **THEY
have followed the manual on 'Creating Controlled Opposition'** to a T
with how they've used Trump to trigger the left and manipulate the
right, playing us all against one another. But I digress.

Please Mike, stop promoting Trump and his "successes". And stop posting
stories about a PERCEIVED attack on him by the 'swamp'. You will notice
that NONE of the legal or character attacks on him are fruitful. This is
because they are intended to fail. **They are part of creating
controlled opposition.** The left celebrates the attacks on Trump (even
though they don't realize they are empty attacks), and the right thinks
that their golden boy is unfairly attacked by a corrupt system that the
left is manipulating. It is ALL theatrics.

Please wake up

## Texas Gov defies Biden's treason as pro-America states form battle lines to defend against invasion

The Governor of Texas has defied the lawless, unconstitutional SCOTUS
order that demands Texas open its border and allow an unlimited invasion
of enemy combatants into the country.

Gov. Abbott has invoked the U.S. Constitution to declare that the rights
of Texas supersede the federal government's powers.

Treasonous democrats are calling for Biden to seize control of the Texas
National Guard. But Oklahoma, Virginia, Florida and other states have
declared they will stand with Texas.

We are rapidly advancing into a civil war scenario over illegal
immigration, and the illegal Biden regime will stop at nothing to see
America completely destroyed and all its citizens exterminated.

This is a fight for our very survival.

When succession collectively occurs across the country , and the USA
economy and dollar collapses simultaneously , the USA will be horribly
weakened. That's when China with UN support will invade the continent ,
activate their sleeper cells that have poured across the border for 3
years straight and take us over .

This scenario is exactly what the globalists want .

To think that China will not take this opportunity to invade then your
head is someplace where the sun don't shine.

Either way the USA, Canada and South America are thoroughly fucked .

Get locked, loaded, and stocked up with food and energy and protect your

Hey Mike, I have said it a few times on this channel: Greg Abbott is a
WEF member. Truth is, Abbott could have stopped all of this back in
2021. This is all part of “their” plan. This is how this finally
destroys our country and breaks it up into regions just as they planned.
This back and forth between Biden and Abbott is all show and used to
kick off the civil war, which will lead to tens of millions of Americans
dead, just as they planned. Once again, Abbott could have done something
way before he allowed roughly 20 million invaders. The 6 million must be
only from the TX border. Here is the current WEF link:

## Twelve states sound the alarm: Globalist banks are conspiring with the UN to wipe out U.S. farms and food production

by Mike Adams

A massive fire at Feather Crest Farms in Texas raises suspicions of more
food sabotage, as multiple chicken houses burn down. More sabotage
appears to be under way against the U.S. food infrastructure.

Meanwhile, agricultural commissioners representing 12 U.S. states have
issued a huge warning to globalist megabanks, saying their **ESG
investing guidelines are essentially a war on farms and will result in
the collapse of U.S. farming and food infrastructure.**

Of course, that's the globalist plan, right?

## Texas chicken farm engulfed for hours in massive blaze

Authorities said that over 100 firefighters were working to extinguish
the blaze on Tuesday

Published January 30, 2024 8:00pm EST

A massive fire engulfed a chicken farm in Texas, demolishing the chicken
coop, with firefighters still working to extinguish the blaze on
Tuesday.

The Bryan Fire Department shared images of the fire, which showed huge
flames and a giant plume of smoke at Feather Crest Chicken Farm, which
is owned by MPS Egg Farms.

The sheriff's office said it received a call about the fire on Monday
evening around 5 p.m., adding that multiple fire departments remained at
the scene Tuesday.

According to authorities, on Tuesday afternoon over 100 firefighters
were still working to put out the blaze.

Officials said multiple factors worked against the firefighters, who
worked throughout the night to put out the massive blaze that had
erupted throughout the metal buildings.

Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire.

The farm, which is located over 100 miles north of Houston, is **in a
remote area without any nearby fire hydrants**, forcing responding
departments to rely on a water shuttle system.

Feather Crest Farms CEO Sam Krouse told Scripps News Waco said that no
one was injured during the fire and that two chicken homes perished in
the blaze.

"The fire affected two chicken houses on site, and we are very sad to
say one house had chickens in it at the time that have been lost,"
Krouse told the local station.

"We are thankful for the swift actions of our entire team and that they
are all safe. We also deeply appreciate the first responders who reached

## Texas Chicken Plant Catches on Fire

\[...\]

Last year, American Faith
[reported](https://americanfaith.com/list-of-103-u-s-food-manufacturing-facilities-destroyed-under-biden-admin/)
that 103 food manufacturing plants had been destroyed under the Biden
administration.

Millions of chickens died, including 5,011,700 in Osceola, Iowa;
1,746,900 in Dixon, Nebraska; 1,380,500 chickens in Lancaster,
Minnesota; 1,501,200 in Cache, Utah; 1,366,200 at Weld Colorado, and
hundreds of thousands more.

50,000 hens were
[killed](https://americanfaith.com/new-zealand-egg-farm-fire-kills-50000-hens/)
after a fire broke out at New Zealand’s largest egg farm in February
2023.

The fires come as the World Economic Forum (WEF) and C40 Cities have
expressed an interest in reducing meat consumption for the sake of
“climate change.”

C40 Cities is a [network](https://www.c40.org/) of mayors working to
“confront the climate crisis.

American Faith
[reported](https://americanfaith.com/14-u-s-cities-to-ban-meat-dairy-private-vehicles-for-2030-globalist-agenda/)
that 14 cities in the United States are part of a plan to
[weed](https://thefederalist.com/2023/08/19/these-14-american-cities-have-a-target-of-banning-meat-dairy-and-private-vehicles-by-2030/)
out meat and dairy products and private vehicle ownership.

American cities involved in the agenda include Austin, Boston, Chicago,
Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia,
Phoenix, Portland, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Seattle.

Some of the “ambitious targets” described by C40 include 0kg of meat
consumption, 0kg of dairy consumption, 0% household food waste, and 0
private vehicles.

## List of 103 U.S. Food Manufacturing Facilities Destroyed Under Biden Admin

“There are currently no nationwide shortages of food,” claims the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.

QUICK FACTS:

-   Although there are now **more than a hundred food processing plants
    that have been destroyed across the country**, the U.S. Department
    of Agriculture has repeatedly
    [denied](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/09/updated-list-us-based-food-manufacturing-plants-destroyed-biden-regime-can-now-participate-add-incidents-interactive-map/)
    “disruptions.”
-   This denial comes despite the fact that while 135 million people
    faced acute food insecurity before the COVID-19 pandemic, that
    number has more than
    [doubled](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-food-shortage-bad-to-worse-un-world-food-programme-102938562.html)
    to 276 million over the last two years.
-   It’s also despite **U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) Chief Economist
    Arif Husain saying of food shortages around the world, “It’s the
    story that keeps getting from bad to worse”** and “When the World
    Food Programme is setting records, that’s not a good thing for the
    world. And we have been doing that since at least 2021.”
-   In fact, one Associated Press (AP) news release
    [reported](https://apnews.com/press-release/news-direct-corporation/lifestyle-9fb6b075dde64ca86c1b837ef447935f)
    that “tens of millions of Americans are already feeling the
    shortages and price hikes” and that **these “alarming trends are
    expected to continue and worsen** in 2023.”
-   And Quartz recently
    [reported](https://qz.com/supply-chain-problems-are-getting-worse-not-better-fo-1849506510)
    how a “recent survey from the Food Industry Association (FMI), a
    trade organization that represents food retailers and wholesalers,
    found that 70% of retailers said supply chain disruptions are
    negatively impacting their business, up from 42% the year before.”
-   “There are currently no nationwide shortages of food,” the
    department’s website nevertheless
    [reads](https://www.usda.gov/coronavirus/food-supply-chain),
    “although in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your
    grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock.”
    “There are currently no wide-spread disruptions reported in the
    supply chain,” the agency reiterated.
-   The Department of Agriculture holds its position notwithstanding Joe
    Biden’s [own
    warnings](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-warns-americans-food-shortage-gonna-be-real-following-sanctions-russia)
    ([here](https://cd.usembassy.gov/president-biden-announces-expansion-of-feed-the-future-in-response-to-the-growing-global-food-security-crisis/))

BACKGROUND:

-   Although gas prices have decreased, food prices have
    [increased](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/food-prices-are-pulling-inflation-up/)
    due to continuing inflation.
-   In the last month, food prices
    [rose](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/monthly-us-consumer-prices-unexpectedly-rise-august-core-inflation-picks-up-2022-09-13/)
    0.8%.
-   **Food prices were also 11.4% higher throughout the last year than

## Senate deal surrenders America to invading illegals as blue cities panic

by Mike Adams

A new "deal" in the US Senate allows 5,000 illegals per day to invade
the USA, while sending insane billions of dollars to both Ukraine and
Israel.

Astonishingly, the money for Ukraine is earmarked to "protect Ukraine's
borders" while the U.S. borders remain wide open.

Denver is now at a "breaking point" according to its mayor, and NYC is
headed for "collapse" due to the ongoing invasion. Yet almost no one in
the Senate will demand ZERO illegals crossing the border.

We have been sold out by traitors. I'm seeing more people online calling
for the arrest and prosecution of those in charge, for carrying out
coordinated, premeditated treason against the United States of America.

The Globalists want 95% reduction of world population and the 5%
survivors as their slaves.

California has done it already. The cartels run. Over our law
enforcement. They are afraid of CARTELS in California, Oregon, and
Washington.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is mainly about the destruction of nations with white populations
that were built by white people. The globalists, who are invariably
Zionists, hate white people and want to get rid of us. Read the
Coudenhove-Kalergi Plan (for the destruction of the Europeran people
through enforced mass third world immigration) Kalergi was one of the
founding fathers of the European Union

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When President Kennedy became President, he stated that he thought he
was the top man. However, he quickly learned the opposite. He would
order some bureaucracy to do something and he was just ignored. One of
the most popular Presidents in history and the swamp ignored him when
they so desired. A President in only a powerful as the tenured
bureaucrats are willing to obey him. Those same bureaucrats now enforce
every executive order because that is what they desire. Trump had four
years and he was constantly on the defensive--both within and outside
the government. The mass's hope in Trump is a false hope. A planned
deception. A total diversion.
