false expectations

masochists being skeptical of anything "too simple"

or, people who naturally prefer the left hand path (good intention, good
cause)  
and in school are forced to go the right hand path (good effect)

**example: using algae blooms to capture CO2 from the atmosphere**

[The highly controversial plan to stop climate
change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Hnv_ZJSQY)

concept:  
lets dump rust (iron oxide) in our oceans  
to produce an algae bloom  
to capture CO2 from the atmosphere (fix climate change)  
to stimulate growth of fish (side effect: more food for us)

this idea is "too simple"  
because its too cheap (rich people hate this)  
and because "the paranoid idiots" (type 4?) are too afraid to "just do
something" (risky)  
and rather prefer to "lets study this another hundred years"  
([analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis))
(overthinking) (toxic passivity)

also:  
all the "smart" people are insulted by such simple solutions  
as they spend (waste) their whole lives looking for complex solutions

but then:  
truth is simple. lies are complex.

or:  
any fool can make things more complex.  
it takes true genius to make things "simple but effective"

and:  
just because you "study" something  
does not mean you have the natural talent for it.  
paradox:  
people who lack the natural talent for something  
will see that something as an "eternal mystery"  
they are "fascinated" by the topic, because they will never understand
it  
but they still try ... (tragic heros, lucifers, rebels against their own
nature)
