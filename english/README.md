# alchi

welcome to our apocalypse.  
welcome to our lifting of the veil.

**humans and their relations** are the last secret of this world.  
lets decode this last secret!

in our view, **psychology and sociology** must be seen as one science.  
both psychology and sociology are only two sides of one coin.  
this one science is the science of mental chemistry, in short: alchemy.
