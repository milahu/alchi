nah, pacifism is the virus, and as a consequence, humans are the virus.

this world is ruled by "militant pacifists" who criminalize serial murder (and tribal warfare).  
in a natural order, serial murder would regularly "purge" the weak, sick, ugly, old, too-many.  
in a made order (human laws), the weak, sick, ugly, old, too-many are "accumulated death" ("accumulated debt") (overpopulation and degeneration)  
until the next mass murder (every 100 years) (debt default) (debt is not meant to be payed off) (boom-bust cycles).

> Human societies have always been autocratic to various degrees

the actual problem is that currently, "the balance" is tilted heavily in favor of "autocracy".

> Power is autocracy. I want to see the day when a great majority of ordinary people finally realise this.

this sounds like you want "the balance" to be tilted in favor of "anti-autocracy"?

my proposed solution is to accept that feudalism (two-class society) (1% rulers and 99% slaves) is a natural constant,  
and that there always will be a global empire exploiting tribes (small states, colonies, "nations", communities) all over the world.

so my proposal is to shift "the balance" away from the over-centralization of today back to "less centralization" and "more selforganization".  
so the tribes have more freedom, and one of the global empire's jobs is to keep the tribes small (no peace alliances) (permanent competition)

we already see this trend to less centralization: secession movements in the USA, EU, Germany, ... all these unions suffer from over-centralization

for more selforganization, we need to solve the radical problems that created this fucked-up world (pacifism) in the first place, mostly:  
the constant criminalization of some personality types (anti-pacifists, anti-socialists)
