jungian extraversion:
E = extravert pathos.
I = introvert pathos.

jungian functions:
N = iNtuition = fire.
S = Sensing = earth.
T = Thinking = air.
F = Feeling = water.

new results:

male gender = romantic center = masculine culture.
female gender = classic center = feminine culture.
... cos both 'male gender' and 'romantic center' are on top.
in theory,
you can also corelate 'female gender' with 'romantic center',
but 'popular definitions' of masculinity
are more similar with 'romantic center'.

new speculation:

this might also be the meaning of the 'age' dimension,
with 'young age' = 'romantic center'
and 'old age' = 'classic center'.

todo: find more translations to the MBTI system.

difference to old 'circle of eight':
now, strong bonds connect air and water.
before, strong bonds did connect (air and air) and (water and water).



Web Of Types vs Circle Of Eight.

how do romantics pair? what are their 'strong bond'?
Web Of Types: M4--F3 and F4--M3
Circle Of Eight: M4--F4 and F3--M3

one argument for the 'Web Of Types' model:
i define pathos as 'other class' type,
so air can never play water,
and water can never play air.
this is why we need proximity of air and water.

one argument for the 'Web Of Types' model:
personal experience.
as M1, i feel closer to M4 than to F3.

one argument for the 'Circle Of Eight' model:
air and water have different diet needs.
air needs 'low carb' and water needs 'high carb' diets.
so, at least for nutrition, air and water should be separated,
and combined with the 'same element'.

another difference:
[really just a consequence of the 'strong bond' diff.]
pathos has different 'meanings' in the two models.
meaning as in: who do you need, when you play that role?
WOT: 124 143   213 234   342 321   431 412
COE: 124 133   213 244   312 331   421 442

both WOT and COE are a 'closed system' or a 'finite group',
so that every pathos (need and play) is found inside the system.
the WOT has 'discrete translation symmetry' [2d grid, lattice group, regular tiling, periodic function],
the COE has 'rotation symmetry' [cyclic group Z8].


names, roles:

air:   improvize     activity
fire:  perfectionize activity
earth: perfectionize passivity
water: improvize     passivity

air + fire = sanguinic mood = actors.
water + earth = melancholic mood = pastors.



how can we break the perfect defense?
with radical simplicity.

a system of common grounds.

if you lack friends, you compensate with principles and paradigms.
if you are trapped in "slave moral" then you are "lost in mating calls" and you are afraid of really finding answers.



physis vs pathos

what is real to one, is (only) image to an other.

real vs image.
serious vs joke.
physis vs pathos.
being vs acting.
strong vs weak.
sane vs pathetic.
rational vs irrational.
close vs distant.



well now.

in terms of CG Jung, i am NI = iNtuition + Introversion.
in terms of alchemy, i am 'fire plays water'.
in terms of psychiatry, i am hebephren-schizophrenic.
or: dreaming for a better reality.
or: god complex, natural authority. [god in private, see Hard Moral.]
or: crazy genius, arrogant dreamer.

claim:
my model is perfect,
that is,
it is so powerful,
it can explain ALL other models.
= i can provide simple translations
to other models.

Four Dimensions.
my base are four binary dimensions:
mood = sanguinic or melancholic
tempo = choleric or phelgmatic
gender = male or female
age = young or old, aka status [#todo is "status" a good synonym?].

class = outer tempo = romantic or classic.
corelations, similars:
psychotics = male, neurotics = female.
sanguinics = young, melancholics = old.

[see end of file for
translations to other models.]

assumption 1: find your self.
tendencies are inborn,
dictated by Body Type.
they fall into four elements:
3. Air = Endomorph.
1. Fire = Mesomorph Heart Shape.
2. Earth = Mesomorph Pear Shape.
4. Water = Ectomorph.
also gender is inborn, obviously.
when born, age == young.
.. so i get Eight Types
in one 'generation' = same age.
8 types = 4 elements x 2 genders.
[side note, the swastika has 8 lines.]

assumption 2: find your peers.
i dream:
every type needs two peers,
or two partners, or two 'next ones'.
ideally from an early age, from day one
= in early childhood.
the 'bonding rules' i found:
strong bonds:
M3 + F3, M1 + F2, M4 + F4, M2 + F1.
weak bonds:
F3 + M1, F2 + M4, F4 + M2, F1 + M3.
3 = Air, 1 = Fire, 2 = Earth, 4 = Water.
M = male, F = female.
all eight types form the Cirlce Of Eight:
    M3--F3
F1          M1
|            |
M2          F2
    F4--M4
line = strong bond.
proximity = weak bond.
upper half = sanguinics = air + fire. [#todo move to lower half = young age = small kids]
lower half = melancholics = water + earth.
left half = matriarchy = female fire = gender opposing body types.
right half = patriarchy = male fire = gender congruent body types.

#todo translation to distant types,
chain of commands,
feedback loop.

Cirlce Of Eight with Romantic Center.

F1        M1

Majority vs Minorities.

Romantic Center = Romantic Majority + Classic Minorities.
Classic Center = Classic Majority + Romantic Minorities.



Who can read Body Type?
Who will lead my Initiation?
Element Fire.
to do so,
one must observe body shape
and body language.
observe with patience.
collect many impressions.
#todo tolerate deviations, exceptions.
logic expression rather shows Secondary Type.
body shape?
'only trust the naked ones.'
[if you do not believe in Physiognomics, skip this part.]
3. Air = endomorph = apple shape, overall chubby and round.
1. Fire = mesomorph + heart shape = strong shoulders.
2. Earth = mesomorph + pear shape = strong hips.
4. Water = ectomorph = banana shape, overall slim and long.
look at the hands.
compare middle finger and palm length.
long fingers = Romantic = Air or Water.
long palm = Phlegmatic = Fire or Water.
compare wrist joint
and the ring of thumb and mid-finger.
wrist bigger = Air = endomorph,
wrist same = Classic = mesomorph,
wrist smaller = Water = ectomorph.
look at the fingers.
strong joints = Air,
straight fingers = Classic,
pointing fingers = Water.
look at the nose.
short + pointed [concave] = Air,
medium pointed = Fire,
medium convex = Earth, [most 'straight' nose]
long + convex = Water.
also, Romantics tend to have a 'double nose tip'.
look at the skin pigment.
Earth has the most pale skin, and most dark genitals + asshole = dark bottom.
look at the nipples.
light and large areolas = air.
dark and small areolas = water.
look at the asshole = anus.
[they also do this in jail, to guess your type.]
light and small hole = sanguinics = air or fire.
dark and large hole = melancholics = water or earth
= chocolate starfish = good for 'passive anal sex'.
also compare mouth to anus.
full lips + small hole = sanguinic mood.
weak lips + strong hole = melancholic mood.
look at the genitals.
small and light = air.
large and dark = water.
[yea, i must be joking..
physiognomics is so unpopular.]
look at the head shape.
round = air, long = water.
look at the nose.
small pointed nose = sanguinics,
large convex nose = melancholics.
look at the chin + lower lip.
small chin = fire,
bigg chin = earth.
look at the ears.
large ears = romantics,
small ears = classics.
[problems come from 'race mixing' and 'small families'
to obfuscate these body signs.
'its all relative'
as in 'relative to the mainstream',
or 'relative to the average'.
if there is no mainstream,
it is more hard to compare.]
look at strength + fat distribution.
earth = strong bottom,
fire = strong front,
air = strong top [head],
water = strong back [cross].
mouth vs genitals.
romantics: strong mouth + weak genitals.
[oral fixated + sexually rather frustrated or frigid.]
classics: weak mouth + strong genitals.
[more physical than mental. strong but dumb.]

Symbols. Signs.
.. for the four elements.
3. Air = circle = three-cloud = three-shamrock.
1. Fire = heart = down = fall = V.
2. Earth = pear = spades = peak = up = rise = Lambda.
4. Water = four-star = cross.
7. Romantics = G [letter 7] = hexagram = rhombus = 'Merkel Raute'
= Square and Compasses = between rise and fall = bisexual.
Square and Compasses also shows the letter G.
12. Classics = celtic cross = between top and bottom = bipolar,
12 = L [as in Loser?], 21 = U, 1221 = ABBA

Three Letters. Three Syllables. ABC parties.
free-ma-sons,
uni-ver-sal,
vi-ven-di,
de-mo-crats,
lu-ba-witsch,
green-par-ty,
CFR,
bil-der-berg,
py-ra-mid,
tri-an-gle,
.... you get the point.
for one, they love to show in numbers. [Numerology]
but then, three syllables have one center syllable,
which is the most important one.
the last syllable is of second importance,
the first syllable is of least importance.
first = signal to start a word.
this can be an 'article' like: le, de, la, etc.
second = center = main syllable.
this will carry the main VOWEL [primitive = infant language].
the second vowel should be emphasized = prolonged, as in
el-saa-tan, ca-ruu-so, da-boo-lus, la-tii-na, etc.
the third syllable is a modifier,
to change the sound of the second vowel.
#todo how exactly? emphasis, deviation, opposition .. 5 vowels = 5 elements



Sine Wave. Year Cycle. Day Cycle.

3. Air = summer = top = june 23 = hour 0.
1. Fire = fall = september 23 = hour 3.
4. Water = winter = bottom = december 23 = hour 6.
2. Earth = spring = rise = march 23 = hour 9.
Romantics = bisexual = between opposite gradients = extreme points.
Classics = bipolar = between opposite curvatures = inflection points.



Eigen Colors.

3. Air = Yellow or White.
1. Fire = Red.
2. Earth = Green.
4. Water = Blue or Black.



#todo ?
Flag Colors.

tri color, from top to bottom.
3. Air = White Yellow White. 
1. Fire = Black Green White. [rare in public. see 'the matrix' movie]
2. Earth = White Red Black. [all over the place in public]
4. Water = Black Blue Black. 
classics wear contrast.
black covers the strong body half,
white covers the weak body half.
center color [accent] shows the 'strong bond' peer.
romantics wear confirmation.
strong body of air is covered in white.
weak body of water is covered in black.



Positive Racism. Black Pride.

leftists love skinny black men so much,
cos they so much look like element water.
.. like a old school shaman,
who can solve ALL the problems.
[actually its 'only' communists
trying to exterminate all classics,
or at least all born fire.]



Names. Personalities [not disorders]. Signs.

3. Air = true Hysteric = optimist = winner = prince = top = high.
1. Fire = true Manic = dominant = posessive = ruler = king = fall = down.
2. Earth = true Borderline = subordinate = slave = rise = up.
4. Water = true Schizo = pessimist = loser = bottom = low.



Secondary Type.

what is psychopathy? [pathos]
the Escape From Loneliness.
provocation. mating call. defense mechanism.
dyscrasia. imbalance. deficiency.

in my model,
false education leads to sick minds.
remember assumption 2: find your peers.
[which would be Better Education,
congruent with natural order = inborn traits.]

every one of the eight body types
is trying to find its two peers.

to find one peer,
i go 'one step further' in the Circle Of Eight.
and play the 'next plus one' type.

example: i am M1 = male fire.
to find my first partner [strong bond],
which is F2 = female earth,
i change to M4 = male water.
in short: fire plays water, to find earth.

if this 'search for peers' is frustrated,
one gets stuck in the 'next plus one' state,
and most time is playing this Secondary Type,
or 'psycho type' in contrast to 'body type'.

fake, made, secondary = conceited not confident, weak not strong.

most psycho tests will only test your 'psycho type',
ignorant [blind] for your 'body type'.



Personality Disorders.

Classic plays Air = fake Hysteric.
Classic plays Water = fake Schizoid.
Romantic plays Fire = fake Manic.
Romantic plays Earth = fake Borderline.

in the Secondary Type, 
you can see the contrast between
born and made,
natural vs artificial,
feel vs know,
physis and pathos,
body and mind,
rule and exception,
noise and signal.

logic expression [talking]
can be interpreted as a 'mating call'
= search for peers.
if not answered [frustrated]
one alone must find an answer [false feedback, monolog].
= 'help your self'
= pushing into loneliness,
away from 'mutual completion'.
a true friend will take your weakness with his strength = completion.
only an enemy will use your weakness for his profit.

example: element fire.
while 'born fire' is a 'natural authority'
and has a feeling for order
= a talent for dominance and selection ..
every 'made fire' 
will only reproduce its learned knowledge.
this is the contrast of 'living gods' vs 'dead gods',
of 'true intelligence' vs 'artificial intelligence'.
look at the Lebowski Dude [Jeff Bridges] as 'born fire'.
signs of 'made fire' are
shortsight = greed for quick profit,
insecurity = explore step by step. 
[Hard Moral]
made fire = OCD = obsessive compulsive disorder.
made = disorder, fake, weakness.
born = personality, strength.

the problem?
feelings tend to be 'weaker' than knowledge,
in a 'culture' [style of education]
that rewards knowledge, and represses feelings.
also,
normopathy [sick majority] 
gives 'false security' to sick ones.
[Group Narcism]
also,
'sensation seeking' rewards the sick ones.
also,
the switch to Secondary Type
was too long ago, so they prefer:
rather change never than late.
possible escapes are:
1. hallucinogens like DMT.
2. TRE = trauma releasing exercises.
both must be used only in a 'good setting'
so one can find the natural peers.
but:
feeling = talent = natural strength = potential = gift.
False Education will always
1. prevent bonding with 'natural peers'
   = push into 'next plus one' states,
   preferrably into the 'introvert' or 'neurotic' state.
2. compensate weakness to 'false security'.
= divide et impera, divide and conquer.
aka Naturalism vs Materialsim:
frustrate natural needs,
compensate with 'dead gods' = material goods
= food, drugs, clothes, toys.
only ugly and weak bodies need clothes to hide.

paradox, rebel, provoke, permanent state of exception, normopathy:
destroy natural order [strong, rule],
and replace with made order [weak, exception].



Melting Pot vs. Cultural Mosaic.

mixed community vs. gated community.
mixing different cultures
is a source of constant Stress.
[see Typical Stress Response]
having a 'homogen community' aka 'closed society'
is privilege for the rich elite.
'the paradise of the rich ones
is made from the hell of the poor ones.'
also, mixed groups have a much higher demand
for 'made order' as in 'police state'.
the 'clash of cultures' generates crime
which generates jobs for police.



all crime is privilege.

'thou shalt not steal' -- but i can!
= the difference between 'you people' and 'me people',
between Slave Moral and Hard Moral.
or: to fight criminals,
police must stand above 'the law',
for Equality Of Arms.



Education [vs. Initiation?]

note how 'civilization' 
[in contrast to primitive culture]
does overrate Education [forced correction]
knowledge and status.
this simply is 'ageism'
= age discrimination
= old over young
= rich over poor
= know over feel
= only kids must learn / follow / change.

this is one way to justify 'made fire',
to justify 'false authority'.



another contrast is Class:

Romantics vs Classics.
rational vs irrational.
realist vs idealist.
sane vs crazy.
shortsight vs farsight.
childish vs mature.
humans vs animals.
smart vs dumb.
open mind vs narrow mind.
bisexual vs bipolar.
deaf vs blind.
eyes vs ears.
in elements:
Air + Water vs Fire + Earth.
3 + 4 vs 1 + 2.
7 vs 12.
G vs R.
[G is letter 7,
and combines circle + cross.]
in functions:
Think + Feel vs Intuit + Sense.
or:
Chaos vs Order
the dream of a 'class less society'
needs to exterminate a whole class,
mostly the class of classics.

classics = bipolar
= bridge between the two poles = moods.
romantics = bisexual
= bridge between the two sexes
= between patriarchy and matriarchy.

the switch to 'next plus one' state
is always a switch of Class.
born romantics play fake classics,
and
born classics play fake romantics.
fake classic = made order
= human written laws, science, etc.
romantics explore with 'trial and error'.
romantic = shortsight, dynamic, fugitive.

Class aka 'outer tempo'.
in contrast to 'inner tempo' = choleric or phlegmatic.
why?
cos mood [sanguinic or melancholic]
and tempo [choleric or phlegmatic]
have similar direction,
they are NOT orthogonal.
sanguinic mood is similar to choleric tempo,
melancholic mood is similar to phlegmatic tempo.
lets translate this similarity to signs:
sanguinic and choleric are positive,
melancholic and phlegmatic are negative:
[translation to Old Alchemy, body humor combinations:]
3. Air = sanguinic choleric = + x +.
1. Fire = sanguinic phlegmatic = + x -.
2. Earth = melancholic choleric = - x +.
4. Water = melancholic phlegmatic = - x -.
result + = Romantic.
result - = Classic.
Sanguinic Mood = self love, leader, commander, resistant to insults.
Choleric Tempo = quick response, neurotic.

Same First vs Other First.
Romantics seek strong bond [first bond]
with the same element [homopolar], of other sex [gender].
.. and weak bond [second bond]
with 'same mood' but 'different tempo'.
R.s they bring short-term equality 
[trade economy, revenge justice]
and produce long-term chaos
[decadence, system crash, hell].
Classics seek strong bond
with 'other mood' and 'other tempo' [bipolar]
.. and weak bond
with 'same mood' but 'different tempo'.
C.s bring short-term 'chaos'
and produce long-term stability
[heaven]

Left vs. Right.
multiple translations seem valid.
1. Right = Patriarchy = Gender Congruent Body Types = "the good swastika".
2. Right = Melancholics.
3. Right = Hard Moral = fire ideal.
4. Right = own group [Group Narcism]
5. Right = Classics.
6. Right = Fire.
7. Right = primitive culture, naturalism.
8. Right = water, Left = air, Up = earth, Down = fire. [Mobile Swastika]

Extravert vs Introvert vs Ambivert.
in my view:
Air = Extravert = romantic leader.
Fire = Introvert = classic leader.
Water + Earth = Ambivert = followers.

Fire is also called 'arrogant'
cos it will never ask [latin rogare = to ask],
and always only answer, or command.
fire is a born oracle, o-raa-cle



Typical Stress Response.

this part was inspired by the buffalo herd order.

in Time Of Stress [threat from outside],
Romantics hide in the center [invisible, black],
Classics are pushed outside [visible, white] = Romantic Center.

in Time Of Peace [outside bears opportunity]
Romantics explore outside [fake friends],
Classics go to center [homies] = Classic Center.

X = center = Romantics in stress.
O = outside = Classics in stress.

In center,
two opposites join for temporal unity.
Time Of Stress: F3--M3 + F4--M4 [other + other]
Time Of Peace: F1--M2 + M1--F2 [same + same]
so,
Romantics seek equality first, contrast second.
Classics seek contrast first, equality second.



Class Justice, Double Moral.

in made order,
Romantics are always preferred,
#todo



Emancipation. Dualism. Tantra.

Mutual Completion. Both Sides.
Balance Of Powers.
Romantics act more 'masculine' like Mars [martial arts],
Classics act more 'feminine' like Venus.
= group gender.
true 'emancipation'
would replace individuals
with 'groups of eight'
to represent all eight types.
or at least M1 + F1
= patriarch + matriarch
= king + queen.



Empire vs Pagans.

Large State and Small States.
Church vs Sects.
Sect as in Person Cult, Small State, Monastery, Gated Community.
see Separation of Church and State.
Civilization vs Primitives.
Republic vs Monarchy.
open system vs. closed system.
large states vs. small states.
remote control vs. self organization.
kill other gods vs. kill other weaks.
sabotage vs. coexistence.
#todo

empire = authoritarian = collectivist.
the empire does occupy colonies,
with the excuse of 'natural chaos'
and a better 'made order'.
that 'made order' 
must be built and protected by force,
[ militant pacifist, fucking for virginity ]
and must be paid for by taxes = by the slaves.
see Hard Moral.





translation to Power Distance and Geert Hofstede.

distant power = empire = large group = normopathy, morality, small families, broken "inner structure" is compensated with "strong government", over-strict, hostility, distrust, anonymity, symbol union, "culture of fear", leaders tend to hide their "ruler knowledge" and tend to sabotage the recruiting of new leaders, greed for profit / short-term success / opportunism.

close power = cult = small group, with mostly complete "inner structure" = close to the Circle Of Eight = close to Natural Order, healthy "extended families", born leaders are easily recruited to made leaders and employed in positions of power, search for long-term stability and strong relations.




Small State.

Tribalism in the sense of 
small paganistic spirtual communties 
caring for eachothers wellbeing 
making due of simple life
#todo



Slave Moral vs. Hard Moral.

see Friedrich Nietzsche, Sklavenmoral vs Herrenmoral.
fire = hard = heart = [german:] herz = herr.
slave moral = 'we are all element earth' = earth ideal.
hard moral = 'we are all element fire' = fire ideal.
earth ideal in public [idiot safe space]
= introvert romantics follow born earth.
fire ideal in private*
= extravert romantics follow born fire.
*private person cult, secret ruler knowledge,
secret societies.
born fire = devil in public, enemy of the state.
Hard Moral tends to steal all good,
to use it as attractor, bait, pull factor, dead god = sex sells,
.. and to spread all bad, 
as push factor, negative motivation, punishment.
= Strategy Of Tension, Crowd Control.
every 'criminal offense' is only a privilege for the elite.
Slave Moral is forced on the majority,
for the goal of profit maximization
= many slaves, small elite.
'the paradise of the rich ones
is made from the hell of the poor ones.'
Judaism is a supremacist ideology 
with thousands of Talmudic laws on 
how to manage non-Jewish slaves.
[most important, how to educate kids to be slaves.]
slave moral = no one is "responsible" [in our group].
hard moral = every one is "responsible" [in our group].
responsible = dominant = fire.



Collectivism vs Individualism.

multiple translations:

1. C = Slave Moral, I = Hard Moral
2. C = Gender Opposing, I = Gender Congruent
3. C = melancholic mood, I = sanguinic mood

collectivist ideal: trustworthy, honest, generous, sensitive, team work, cooperation, community man.
individualist ideal: assertive, strong, competition, artistic, bohemian.



Masculinity index. masculine vs feminine

multiple translations:

1. M = romantic center, F = classic center
2. M = psychotic, F = neurotic
3. M = sanguinic, F = melancholic

M: assert, hunt, compete, expand, fight, aggress, work, start wars, impatient, business over art, radical: destroy + build new, action, dominate in mild climate, intensive farming, industry, innovate, explore, modern, greed, hyper-active, much work + little life, work for fun, sportive, playful

F: nurture, heal, repair, gather, relate, lazy, defend, protect environment, diplomacy, art over business, plan, organize, settle, dominate in hard climate, extensive farming, tradition, oldschool, hyper-passive, little work + much life, work to survive, mature

M: japan, USA, germans, ireland, UK, mexico, italy
F: sweden, NL, spain, thailand, korea, portugal, middle east, west africa

or: if i play a role, then i miss some one.

most people have to grow up without 'born leaders',
and are trained to follow 'made leaders',
and maybe later they can be 'made leaders' too.
'made leaders' only lead for a short time [election cycle],
and they only lead in their field of expertise.
but 'perfection' is more than a 'sum of partial solutions'.
integrity is the natural talent of element fire.
.... to organize 'social integrity'
and to 'bring together who belongs together'.
mating. coupling. mediating.
'the [bad] media' do the opposite:
they divide those, who belong together,
and they 'sublimate' natural attraction forces
into 'motivation to self-harm'.
[motivation psychology, rape and pull, reverted escape]



Humanistic Euthanasia

another sign of Hard Moral is Humanistic Euthanasia.
= to get rid off 'bad guys'
they ban bad guys away from public territory,
into loneliness = isolation,
so they either starve to death,
or apologize and come back.
romantics always overrate learning and education.
aka 'forced exorcism' = beat the shit out of a bad guy.
[for 'better exorcism' see TRE = Trauma Releasing Exercises.]
romantics feel 'nature is chaos' and must be controlled.
= all humans are born equal [egalitee, tabula rasa]
and must be educated, as in:
rewarded for good, punished for bad behavior.
= conditioning, brain washing.
also,
sterilization is Humanistic Euthanasia.
= kill their kids.



Group Narcism.

all 'groups' offer security for their members.
in return, members see their group as good,
or better than other [neighbor] groups.
other groups can serve as scapegoat
= projection of self critic.



Heritage. Caste System.
#todo

Ethic Of Intention. Gesinnungs Ethik.
False Patience. Endless Cycles.
when romantics produce chaos,
they as true opportunists
will excuse with:
at least i had good intentions.
Intention vs Response.
idea vs realization.
image vs real.
another way to 'escape from responsibility'
is False Patience:
they will make you wait forever.
they will promise a better future,
but they will never deliver.
[see Perfect Hoax]



Internal Gender.

every element prefers one gender.
in my symbolism,
this is seen on the bottom.
male elements have pointy bottoms:
heart + cross = fire + water.
female elements have round bottoms:
pear + circle = earth + air.
if the 'outer gender'
is same as the 'inner gender',
the type is a
Gender Congruent Body Type,
or is part of the Patriarchy half.



Astrology.

calendar astrology only works for 1 in 4.
why?
cos element and gender are random!
and not corelated with birth time.
still, astrology is useful.
the 12 zodiac signs
are 4 elements x 3 modalities.
4 elements:
3. air = libra, gemini, aquarius.
1. fire = aries, leo, sagittarius.
2. earth = virgo, taurus, capricorn.
4. water = pisces, scorpio, cancer.
3 modalities:
cardinal + mutable + fixed.
my translation?
modality mutable = natural type.
modalities cardinal + fixed = secondary types.
astrology literature
provides tons of details
to the four elements.
some details can be ignored.
public texts [Slave Moral, earth ideal]
will always focus on 'positive aspects'.
negative aspects
are hidden away from public
to Hard Moral [fire ideal] and secret societies.



Four Vocals.

-ee- = Air,
-aa- = Fire,
-oo- = Earth,
-uu- = Water.
-ii- = Fifth Element? = Spirit, Group, Ring, System.
[air could be -ii- as well.]
why the notation of -xx-?
cos, names are made of 3 syllables.
my name is mi-laa-no,
aa = long vocal, i + o = short vocals.
the 'main signal' is in the center syllable,
start + end syllables only 'fill the void'.
other names:
he-lee-na, don-huu-go, a-doo-nis, ta-maa-ra,
ra-moo-na, li-mee-ro,

Euthanasia vs World War.

organized retreat vs chaotic collapse.
close combat vs distant weapons.
born fire = eugenics AND euthanasia
= genius AND madman.
made fire destroys this balance.
in peace time,
eugenics [work] is rewarded
and euthanasia is repressed.
.. repressed until the next war
= all poor and unworthy are killed,
with 'distant weapons'.

so to really prevent war,
born fire must regularly 
kill [sacrifce] other humans.
.. either of its own tribe,
or of neighbor tribes.

but actual murder
is only the second step in 'hunting'.
the first step is done by born air.
air can 'win' the prey,
capture it and bring it to fire.
fire will then rule over life and death of the prey.
= decide if it is worthy to live, or not.

born fire brings quick and peaceful death,
made fire prefers torture and rape [rape culture],
to search [provoke] born fire.
[to stop the pain, to redeem the prey = mercy kill.]



Systematic Procrastination.

hunting for small fish is so much easier.
distraction from bigger problems.
street crime as scapegoat for white collar crime.
#todo



Remote Control. Crowd Control.

Strategy Of Tension.
Mutation and Selection.
romantic slaves [Slave Moral] 
explore with 'trial and error'.
they randomly visit all directions,
and learn from short-term success.
romantic leaders [Hard Moral]
only punish 'bad moves' [minority],
all others are tolerated [majority]
and indirectly rewarded with freedom.
so the 'good slaves' enjoy freedom
and try to inspire other slaves
with their 'recipe for success'.
in contrast,
all 'bad slaves' who try to do 'bad moves'
are punished by the slave collective = mob rule.
#todo five monkeys experiment hoax



Shitstorm Incoming.

some people will reduce my work to
'you only want to be a legal serial killer.'
and they are right,
but i also want to be a 'serial father'.
eugenics AND euthanasia, in balance.
and not only I, but all element fire.
we need more leaders, and less slaves.
= the opposite of 'profit maximization'.



Majority Vote. Mob Rule.

Group Think. Democracy.
made fire always
only represents a majority,
never the wholeness = entity.
only born fire
will find 'perfect solutions'
to serve the whole eco system,
and not only 'humanity'.



Totalitar vs Perfect.

to FORCE majority to 'fake entity',
made fire must murder all born fire.
as in witch hunts.
burn the witch = punish born fire with made fire.
also 'jews' were burned in nazi camps.
INRI = Iustum Necar Reges Impios [jesuit oath]
= it is good to murder kings lacking respect.
.. respect for made fire = fake kings.
killing born fire is a way
to get rid off competitors, and maximize profit.
remember public vs private:
in public, all 'made fire' must be worshipped.
only in private, critic is tolerated.
[maybe i should join some secret society.]
perfect = whole = hermetic = complete = circle = closed.



Intensive vs. Extensive

extensive = casual, easy, loving, lazy, effective, use amplification, minimal culture.
intensive = the hard way, forced, brutal, hateful.



Diffusion vs. Osmosis.

limit, border, membrane
passive vs active
follow vs control
#todo



Common Grounds.

1. same class.
2. same mood.
3. same congruency = Matriarchy or Patriarchy.
4. same gender.
no common ground is 'inner tempo' = choleric or phlegmatic.
every one of the eight types has exactly one 'opposite type'
with zero common ground.
to find that 'opposite type',
1. switch mood.
2. switch gender
3. switch class.
or:
1. keep inner tempo
2. switch mood
3. switch gender.
so, opposite types are:
F3 vs M2
M1 vs F4
F2 vs M3
M4 vs F1
these share zero 'common ground'
and will never feel sympathy.



Black Sheep and White Wolf.

many families have a 'black sheep' kid.
it simply feels strange,
and this 'antipathy' [feeling of distance]
will produce endless conflict.
'if you love then let go.'
but,
let go to where?
in past times, to a monastery.
today, to jail or psychiatry.
just,
why not find a better family?
'my enemys friend'
'my two enemies could be friends'
if your child is your 'enemy'
and another family is your 'enemy',
chances are good,
your 'strange' kid would love that other family.



Perfect Hoax.

made order, and all 'ideologies'
promise a better future
but will never deliver.
they are a waste of time.
or,
you must die to find the truth.
also,
'near death experiences'
and 'ego death' trips from hallucinogens
must be censored away from public.
in general,
all comparison is forbidden,
all opposition is infiltrated and sabotaged.
only small deviations are tolerated,
you have the choice between shit and shit.
[South Park: Vote Or Die]



Anarchists.

anarchists are 'archs' them selves.
arch = heart = fire = prime.
#todo or: arch = psychotic, patri-arch = male psychotics?
just like atheists are gods them selves = heretics.
both oppose 'false authority' and 'dead gods'.
cos the 'natural work' of born fire
is ruined by made fire.
farsight is sacrificed for short-term profit.
born fire is only needed as scapegoat for the next recession.
= when it is too late for prevention and farsight.



Fire Test. False Expectations.

in witch hunts, born fire is burned in made fire.
if it survives, it is a devil, or a god.
if it dies, it was only a human.
see Perfect Hoax.



Racism vs Race Mixing.

racism and inbreeding
are censored as Hard Moral for the elite.
but racism is a tendency of Classics,
who seek to stabilize one phenotype.
in sociology,
racism = cultural mosaic, gated communities.
race mixing = melting pot, open borders.
classics = racists are 'blind'
= they seek 'optic uniform'
in contrast to romantics who are 'deaf'
= they seek 'symbol uniform' [german: Sprachgemeinschaft]
= 'one nation under a symbol' = romantic center.
Race Mixing is one way to prevent Physiognomics
= to hide 'typical' body shapes.
for example, breed 'jews' with smaller noses.
[the typical 'jew nose' [long + convex] shows element water.]
also Plastic Surgery can hide body signs.



Eugenics Rules.

1. separate generations.
allow breeding only every 5 years, for example,
to allow more kids of same age to 'grow up together'.
2. only 'strong bond' pairs should breed.
3. let the kids decide, who they bond to,
both to other kids of same age,
but also to 'parents' of old age.
kids need proximity to all eight types.
[if you love, then let go,
and what is yours, will return to you.]
4. allow kids to play and sleep together.
do not force them to sleep alone.
we all sleep better with our partner.
[if they find sex on their own, why not?]



Cover Noise and Hidden Signals.

Chaffing and Winnowing.
Steganography.
the elite loves 'hiding in plain sight'.
pushing desinformation is one way
to hide Hard Moral = secret ruler knowledge.
most 'esoteric and occult' scripts are desinformation 
aka cover noise, distraction, spam, encryption, sabotage.
encrypt = hide signal in cover noise.
mostly they show up in numbers.
examples?
i was in jail for exact 33 months.
all my court hearings were at 9 o clock. 9 = 3 x 3.
the 'sum of digits' of my court dates are 7 = romantics.
they placed 'fake evidence' in my friends home,
and the weight of the bag was exact my birthday.
they punished my friend as 'jew helper',
cos he offered me refuge for some time.
back to Cover Noise.
cover noise is any nonsense
that puts the 'weak minded' into sleep.
but from time to time,
they place Hidden Signals,
as trigger or reminder.
also 'system crash' and 'war'
serve as Cover Noise, to
a. get rid off enemy leaders [devils]
b. occupy resources cheap.



Security By Obscurity.

Reality Obfuscation. Closed Source.
Remote Control. No One Is Responsible.
Dead God Cults hide Person Cults.
so the ruling elite can always escape from responsibility
by saying: 'we did this for humanity'
[or any other 'dead god' or ideal].
and: 'we all are only servants'. [anarchy?]
scapegoats [small fish] are sacrificed as 'responsible ones'
to satisfy the mob [romantic slaves?].
also,
hiding Hard Moral does weaken rivals,
[monopoles hate all rivals]
and does increase profit.
[secret recipe for success]

to distract slaves from 'real problems',
masters create 'pseudo problems'.
this is an effective solution in the short term,
but when the 'real problems' get bigger,
the 'distraction machine' grows bigger,
which will further increase the 'waste of energy',
and increase the 'real problems'.
= the 'vicious circle' of distraction and waste.
= 'blind activism'



Climate Selects Culture.

three climate zones:
1. tropic
2. moderate
3. polar.
in tropic climate, romantics dominate.
in moderate climate, you see 'clash of cultures'.
in polar climate, classics dominate.
from tropic to polar, from hell to heaven.
colonization tried to bring classic culture to tropic climate.
migration from africa to europe tries to bring romantic culture to moderate and polar climate. [sweden is one example for polar climate]
both are 'weapons of migration', destructive to the target culture.



Heretics. Prepare For The Worst.

consider this information as a leak.
spreading this 'truth' in public
will lead to punishment.
heretics = low status element fire,
who is claiming privileges,
like its natural right to murder.
INRI = iustum necare reges impios
= it is right to kill kings who lack respect.
this is secret information for the private domain.
= Hard Moral.



Information Technology.

trying to solve the conflict of
distance and proximity.
in short, you cant!
you can never have proximity aka trust
to some one who is far away from you.
far away in miles or years.
no one can prove jesus christ,
or what he said.
plus, you have no feedback channel
to clarify ambiguities,
to get answer to your questions.
of course you can try to ask = pray,
but you will never get an answer.
except for hallucinations or [synthetic] telepathy
aka someone else playing with you [remote control].

Allah gave the Jinn the free will to obey or disobey Him like man.
The majority of the Jinn are Kuffar.
15. The Angles are generally described with praise worthy traits. 
Most of the Jinn are described as being whispers of evil, plotters, deceivers, and oppressors.

NWO. New World Order.

A One World Government and one-unit monetary system, under permanent non-elected hereditary oligarchists who self-select from among their numbers in the form of a feudal system as it was in the Middle Ages.
population will be limited
There will be no middle class, only rulers and the servants.
those who are obedient and subservient to the One World Government will be rewarded with the means to live; those who are rebellious will simple be starved to death or be declared outlaws, thus a target for anyone who wishes to kill them.
The magnitude of deceit in this conspiracy is mind boggling
Most people react with disbelief
unaware that they have been conditioned (brainwashed) to react with skepticism by institutional and media influences that were created by the Mother of All mind control organizations: The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. 
[trigger words, taboo topics, end of debate/peace, signal for war]
Author and de-programmer Fritz Springmeier (The Top 13 Illuminati Bloodlines ) says that most people have built in "slides" that short circuit the mind's critical examination process when it comes to certain sensitive topics. 
"Slides", Springmeier reports, is a CIA term for a conditioned type of response which dead ends a person's thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic. For example, the mention of the word "conspiracy" usually solicits a slide response with many people.
[manufactured consent, majority vote]
What most Americans believe to be "Public Opinion" is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. Public opinion polls are really taken with the intent of gauging the public's acceptance of the Illuminati's mind controlled programs. A strong showing in the polls tells the Illuminati that the programing is "taking", while a poor showing tells the NWO manipulators that they have to recast or "tweak" the programming until the desired response is achieved.
[strategy of tension]
The NWO global conspirators manifest their agenda through the skillful manipulation of human emotions, especially fear.



#todo condense. make this shorter.
Problem, Reaction, and Solution.

Problem = conflict, argument, dualism
The technique is as follows: 
Illuminati strategists create the Problem- 
by funding , assembling, and training an "opposition" group to stimulate turmoil in an established political power (sovereign country, region, continent, etc.) that they wish to impinge upon and thus 
create opposing factions in a conflict that the Illuminati themselves maneuvered into existence. In recent decades, so called 
"opposition" groups are usually identified in the media as 'freedom fighters' or 'liberators' (most recently
the KLA-Kosovo Liberation Army). At the same time, 
the leader of the established political power where the conflict is being orchestrated is demonized and, on cue, referred to as 'another Hitler' (take your pick: Saddam Hussein, Milosevic, Kadaffi, Osama bin-Laden etc.). 
The 'freedom fighters' are not infrequently assembled from a local criminal element (i.e. KLA, drug traffickers). 
In the spirit of true Machiavellian deceit, the same NWO strategists are equally involved in covertly arming and advising the leader of the established power as well (the Illuminati always profits from any armed conflict by loaning money, arming, and supplying ALL parties involved in a war).

Reaction = fear, 'free us from evil'
The conflict is drawn to the world stage by the controlled media outlets with a barrage of photos and video tape reports of horrific and bloody atrocities suffered by innocent civilians. The cry goes up "Something has to be done!" And That is the desired Reaction (note: the same technique is presently being used to bring about gun control in the United States).

Solution = restore peace, unity .. brought by a 'third party'
The NWO puppeteers then provide the Solution by sending in UN 'Peace Keepers' (Bosnia) or a UN 'Coalition Force' (Gulf War) or NATO Bombers and then ground troops (Kosovo). Once installed, the 'peace keepers' never leave (Bosnia). 
The idea is to have NWO controlled ground troops in all major countries or strategic areas 
where significant resistance to the New World Order takeover is likely to be encountered.
[sabotage]

The local, sovereign military force is either defeated (i.e. Yugoslavia) or, as in the case of the United States, replaced by foreign UN "Partnership For Peace" (PFP) troops who take over the jobs of US soldiers who have been sent overseas on 'peacekeeping' missions.

Child Sacrifice.

another sign of Hard Moral.
members of the elite will participate
in ritual child sacrifice.
the more Intensive, the better.
= spectacular, torture, rape, carnage.
background:
element fire does murder 'unwanted children'
so parents can focus all their energy on 'wanted kids'.
born fire does 'mercy kill' = put to sleep with poison = peaceful death.
the 'pro life' ideal
is one way to sabotage families,
to force them to also raise 'unwanted kids',
who will in turn always hate their parents
[for not killing them in the first place,
and not giving them a 'good life'.]

child murder, cannibalism
= hard moral, fake fire.



Hot and Cold.
air is the first to freeze = loves summer,
fire will freeze top first [head, chest],
earth will freeze bottom first [feet, ass],
water is the last to freeze = loves winter = cUUl. [i hate that vowel shift.]



middle class = classics = mesomorph.
ruling class = romantics with fire ideal [hard moral],
working class = romantics with earth ideal [slave moral].
enemy of the communist state is element fire = devil in public.

the lie of Calendar Astrology.
not all astrology is fake.
but one part is: Calendar Astrology
= birth time dictates element.
this only works in 1 of 4,
cos element is chosen by random,
and all elements are equally frequent.

translation to Hans Eysenck.

"The factor of neuroticism constitutes a biological unit"

"neurotic predisposition is to a large extent determined."

neuroticism = neurotic tempo.
extraversion = extravert mood.

Psychoticism = B5C + B5A 
= Big Five Conscientiousness and Big Five Agreeableness.

impulsive = extravert or neurotic [neurotic!].

Hans Eysenck translation to Immanuel Kant.
1. fire  = PE = Galen sanguine type
2. earth = NI = Galen melancholic type
3. air   = NE = Galen choleric type
4. water = PI = Galen phlegmatic type
--> tempo over mood, air is more similar to earth than to fire.

Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused 
by variability in cortical arousal: 
"introverts are characterized by 
higher levels of activity than extraverts 
and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts".[39] 
Similarly, Eysenck proposed that 
location within the neuroticism dimension 
was determined by individual differences 
in the limbic system.[40] 
While it seems counterintuitive to suppose 
that introverts are more aroused than extraverts, 
the putative effect this has on behaviour is such that 
the introvert seeks lower levels of stimulation. 
Conversely, 
the extravert seeks to heighten his or her arousal 
to a more favourable level 
(as predicted by the Yerkes-Dodson Law) 
by increased activity, social engagement 
and other stimulation-seeking behaviours. 

[ introversion = melancholic mood or psychotic tempo or classic class ]

"against the equality of people" = "The Inequality of Man" = "racist" = Hard Moral or classic class.

equality: potential vs success.
success: short- vs long-term.

"Equality of social status has always been a socialist idea, 
and it is certainly possible to argue 
about its desirability, or the possibility of achieving it. 
Equality of biological abilities and traits is a chimera 
which no thinking person should entertain for one moment."

2. earth = Galen melancholic type
3. air   = Galen choleric type
4. water = Galen phlegmatic type

came to refer just to psychological dispositions, 
Galen used it to refer to bodily dispositions, 
which determined a person's

translation to Colin DeYoung big five abstraction.

stability = JDA = classic = ability to maintain __stable__ relationships, motivation and emotional states.

He offers that this general ability may be linked to the rostral serotonergic system which in turn has been linked to emotion and motivation regulation.[11] Reductions in a serotonin variant in the region of the midbrain associated with this system have been linked to "aggressiveness (low Agreeableness) and impulsiveness (low Conscientiousness and low Emotional Stability)"[10]

[ low serotonin = romantic OR air ]

plasticity = JDB = extravert = cognitive flexibility = John Digman beta factor = extraversion + openness = "young age" = learn easy.

He hypothesizes links to the central dopaminergic (DA) system. Extraversion had been previously linked to the DA system.[12] In addition, extraversion and openness to experience are both linked to latent inhibition reduction[10] which is moderated by the DA system.[13] These underlying biological correlates combined with DeYoung's conceptual arguments form the foundation of his case for "stability" and "plasticity" as labels and interpretations of Digman's Alpha and Beta factors.

translation to Janek Musek and General Factor Of Personality.

aka "The Big One" personality factor.

good = desirable = attractive = air = optimism + motivation = self love + activity = extravert + neurotic.

optimism scale: air > fire > earth > water.

this confirms my assumption of "mood over tempo", as in: air is more similar to fire than to earth, and water is more similar to earth than to fire.

also, this "big one" factor assumes "classic center".
if you assume "romantic center", then you get a complementary "big one" factor of "dominance":

dominance scale: fire > air > water > earth = sanguinic scale with romantic center.

classicism scale: fire > earth > water > air = 'dryness' = class scale with melancholic center.

psychotic tempo [or dominance]
= eclectic not conventional = dissident = nonconformist = heretic
= syncretic not special 
= 'natural order'

= self-aware = metacognition

= polymath = universal = many interests

= natural science = interdisciplinary = transcendental 
= [classic: middle class] = [classic: perfectionist].

antiauthoritarian education:
The idea of a universal education was essential 
to achieving polymath ability, 
hence the word university was used 
to describe a seat of learning. 
At this time, 
universities did not specialize in specific areas, 
but rather trained students in a broad array of 
science, philosophy and theology. 
This universal education gave them 
a grounding 
from which they could continue into apprenticeship 
toward becoming a master of a specific field.

Complementarity
Complementarity in social psychology 
is defined on the basis of 
the interpersonal circle (Carson, 1969), 
according to which interpersonal behaviors 
fall on a circle with two dimensions, namely 

dominance (i.e. dominant–submissive) and 
warmth (i.e. hostile–friendly). 

It states that each interpersonal behavior 
invites certain responses of another interactant. 
The behavior and the response it invites 
are said to be complementary 
(Horowitz, Dryer, & Krasnoperova, 1997) 
when friendly behavior begets hostile behavior, 
and dominant behavior begets submissive behavior. 
When people fail to give the invited response, 
it is said to be a non-complementary interaction. 
If the first person's behavior 
invites a reaction from the second person 
that matches the second person's goals, 
then the second person is satisfied; 
otherwise, the second person is frustrated 
(Dryer & Horowitz, 1997).

romantic = open mind + short term.

ring 2 = cooperative versus pragmatic
weak = cooperative, complying, respectful, polite, do whats right, popular, MBTI feelers, seek harmony, follow others ethics.
strong = pragmatic, utilitarian, adaptive, selfish, do what works, independent, MBTI thinkers, own values, ignore popularity.

ring 3 = informing or directing = weak or strong.

    The third ring distinguishes between people who generally communicate by informing others versus people who generally communicate by directing others.



ring 4 = expressive versus attentive = teach or learn = old or young = act or observe = actor or pastor = talk or show.

old age is similar to melancholic mood.




Guardians are concrete and organized (scheduled). Seeking security and belonging, they are concerned with responsibility and duty. Their greatest strength is logistics. They excel at organizing, facilitating, checking, and supporting. The two roles are as follows:

Administrators are the directive (proactive) Guardians. Their most developed intelligence operation is regulating. The attentive Inspectors and the expressive Supervisors are the two role variants.
Conservators are the informative (reactive) Guardians. Their most developed intelligence operation is supporting. The attentive Protectors and the expressive Providers are the two role variants.

Idealists are abstract and compassionate. Seeking meaning and significance, they are concerned with personal growth and finding their own unique identity. Their greatest strength is diplomacy. They excel at clarifying, individualizing, unifying, and inspiring. The two roles are as follows:

Mentors are the directive (proactive) Idealists. Their most developed intelligence operation is developing. The attentive Counselors and the expressive Teachers are the two role variants.
Advocates are the informative (reactive) Idealists. Their most developed intelligence operation is mediating. The attentive Healers and the expressive Champions are the two role variants.

a < b < c < d = water < earth < fire < air = mood scale with classic center



infiltration

all types do corelate gender and tempo.
in the right side, males are psychotic, and so on.
the difference is,
psychotics 'can' be aware of that bias,
and can (ab-) use it, to infiltrate neurotics on the 'other side'.
[neurotics are much more 'sexist',
as in, they can not control their 'gender is tempo' bias.]
to infiltrate,
the psychotic must play his neurotic pathos:
fire play air, water play earth.
13 = 143, 42 = 412.
these pathos roles call for 'the other psychotic' of same gender.
fire (need water) play air, water (need fire) play earth.
probably, that other psychotic must be absent for this play.
[ = horizontal infiltration to 'other side']

speculation:
psychotics feel 'tempo over mood',
neurotics feel 'mood over tempo'?
this is why neurotics are 
easy to infiltrate by 'psychotic play neurotic'.
reciproke,
psychotics are more 'mood blind'
and should be
easy to infiltrate by 'other-mood play same-mood'.
[ = vertical infiltration to 'other age']
fire (sanguinic mood)
could be infiltrated by 213 (or 431).
water (melancholic mood)
could be infiltrated by 342 (or 124).

the term 'infiltration' sounds rather negative.
as all 'technology', this can be used for good or bad.
these might be communication channels
between 'left side' and 'right side',
while psychotics tend to 'control' or 'respond',
and neurotics tend to 'report' or 'ask'.
#todo remove



Left Side and Right Side.

left  = gender opposing types  = F1 M2 M3 F4
right = gender congruent types = M1 F2 F3 M4

communication between left and right side
is done by the Romantic Center in time of stress,
and by the Classic Center in time of peace.



colors

1. fire  = yellow
2. earth = green
3. air   = red
4. water = blue

classic = yellow + green = lime = light
romantic = red + blue = purple = dark

taking the 'red pill'
= classics switch
from 'introvert pathos' = play water
to 'extravert pathos' = play air.
= activation, stimulation, wake up.



sleep state vs wake state.

when all types in a quartet
play their 'introvert pathos'
= 'melancholic mood'
at the same time,
then their 'pathos arrows' form a 'down spiral'.



sleep state of the bottom-left quartet:

      4─┐
┌─────┐ │
4 ┌─3 2 │
  │ 4 1─┘ 2
  │ └─────┘ 
  └─2

the sleep state
in the bottom octet [classic center],
shows a 'left swastika'

with the four arms pointing counter-clockwise,
with opposite arms forming the character Z,
hence 'ZZ swastika'.

this is the symbol of 'mass hypnosis',
'opium for the masses' [alcohol],
dumbing down, mass destruction,
melting pot, egalitarianism,
avoid conflict, overrate conformism,
false patience, bad sleep, over passive,
forced peace with depressant agents,
mass sabotage, naive hope for the best,
confusion, uncertainty, agnostic,
'melancholic ideal', weak and lazy,
adrenal fatigue, rest and digest response,
sleepwalkers, dreamers, dropouts,
dogma of blasphemy, ignorance,
'they live + we sleep',
all are receiving, but no one is sending,
passive loneliness.



wake state of the bottom-left quartet:

  ┌─1
  │ ┌─────┐
  │ 3 2─┐ 1
3 └─4 1 │ 
└─────┘ │
      3─┘

the wake state
in the bottom octet [classic center],
shows a 'right swastika'
with the four arms pointing clockwise,
with opposite arms forming the character S,
hence 'SS swastika'.

this is the symbol of 'mass hysteria',
'cocaine for the masses' [nicotine],
pushing up, mass distraction,
fun time, play time, 
work off, work out, steam off,
sublimation of aggression,
'sanguinic ideal', confident and active,
dogma of heresy, provocation,
confront problems, overrate deviance,
comfort eating, comfort fucking,
adrenal rush/high/arousal, flight and fight response,
blind actionism, active waste of energy,
all are sending, but no one is receiving,
active loneliness.

in the lower octet [classic center],
sleep state = right ZZ swastika
wake  state = left  SS swastika

the 'nazi swastika' or 'mobile swastika'
is tilted by 45 degrees = quarter circle,
opposed to the 'hindu swastika',
with only horizontal and vertical lines.

speculation, probable solution:
the quartets should be split,
either by 'same class' = 'strong bond',
or by 'same tempo' = 'weak bond',
and they should be free
to switch between the two splits
= between the first two bond types
= strong bond vs weak bond.
actors/players and pastors/observers should be split,
and the roles should be switched frequently.



translation to Avicenna of Afshona, weight

weight = mood = warmth [Galen]:
light = sanguinic mood = warm.
heavy = melancholic mood = cold.

Cosmology:
dominance (and mood) scale: fire > air > water > earth.
= dominance over mood
= mood scale with romantic center.



translation to Three Great Planes

P1 = 12. Physical  = fire + earth
P2 =  4. Mental    = water
P3 =  3. Spiritual = air

or swap air and water:

P1 = 12. Physical  = fire + earth
P2 =  3. Mental    = air
P3 =  4. Spiritual = water

= 'the great scale of Life'
= fire < earth < air < water
= class scale with neurotic center.

or:
= fire < earth < water < air
= class scale with melancholic center.

i place fire as the 'oldest element'
cos fire is the 'classic leader'
and 'most hated' in Slave Moral.



translation to equality of sacrifice

cartoon by JF Horrabin, year 1929
published in 'plebs, organ of the NCLC', year 1931

3. air   = the 10.000 pound man
4. water = the  1.000 pound man
2. earth = the    250 pound man
1. fire  = the   unemployed man

the four men stand on a ladder,
two of five parts are under water,
man one and two stand above the water line,
man three stands half in the water,
man four is starting to drown,
only his head and hands are above water.

the man at the top [air]:
equality of sacrifice,
that is the big idea, friends!
let us all step down one rung!

Welfare Spending: Soaking the Poor

‘A famous old cartoon shows 
a grand man at the top of a ladder 
which slopes down to a river, 
with less flashy fellows 
on each of the rungs below him.

“Just one more step down,” 
yells the man at the top, 
paying no heed to the man at the bottom, 
whose head is only just out of the water. 

The test of George Osborne’s budget ...’ 

(Editorial, The Guardian, 23 June 2010)

Osborne’s claims of fairness are now exposed as a fraud

‘This isn't the first time in Britain's history 
that politicians with a programme of savage cuts 
have claimed “we're all in this together”. 
An iconic Labour movement cartoon from the early 30s, 
when another coalition came to power 
in the wake of a financial crisis and slump,
shows four class stereotypes of the day on a ladder. 
A cloth capped unemployed man 
is standing at the bottom, up to his neck in water.
“Equality of sacrifice – that's the big idea, friends!”
says the silk-hatted figure at the top.
“Let's all step down one rung.”

Strip away the anachronisms
and that’s exactly the message
George Osborne tried to give in his budget,
as he unveiled
the deepest and fastest cuts in public spending
since the same period.
David Cameron was at it again yesterday,
claiming the budget would "protect the poor".'

(Seumas Milne, The Guardian, 24 June 2010)

= mature not childish
= slow to learn / adapt
fire more than earth,
cos of sanguinic mood = proud, stubborn, radical

2. rural third estate, carrier, farmer = earth
1. animals = fire



compound name vs own/eigen/atomic name

--> integrate atoms to groups,
or differentiate to components.

'class' and 'tempo' are useful groups,
cos they corelate with
the first two bonds: strong bond + weak bond.

'gender' and 'age' are the next useful groups,
to describe 'gender congruent' vs 'gender opposing' groups,
and 'romantic center' vs 'classic center' groups.

these groups are 'useful'
cos they are 'real' and not 'imaginary'.

if you want to build more 'obscure' systems,
then you need to use more imaginary groups,
to hide the 'real structure' of atoms.
