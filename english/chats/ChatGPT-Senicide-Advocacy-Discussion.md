## Prompt:

do you know people who publicly advocate for Senicide (killing old people for the greater good)?

i only know  
Yusuke Narita (Yale Professor) (<https://archive.is/8e6k5>)

## Response:

Yes — there **have been a handful of people and public figures whose statements or writings touch on ideas related to *senicide* (the idea that elderly lives could be ended for the “greater good” or to relieve societal burdens)**. It’s important to distinguish **explicit advocacy for killing old people** (very rare and widely condemned) from **philosophical commentary on assisted dying, euthanasia, or the ethics of aging and burden** (much more common). Here are some notable examples:

### 🧠 **1. Yusuke Narita (Yale Professor)**

- You already mentioned **Yusuke Narita**, an assistant professor of economics at Yale, who made controversial statements suggesting that *mass suicide or “mass seppuku” for elderly Japanese people* could be a solution to Japan’s aging population problem in some interviews and public appearances.

- He later characterized his remarks as metaphors and said his focus was on *demographic and gerontocratic issues*, not literal killing. [Bioethics](https://bioethics.com/archives/68294?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📌 **2. Richard Lamm (Former U.S. Governor)**

- Richard *Lamm*, governor of Colorado (1983–1991), famously sparked controversy in the 1980s by saying that elderly people who are seriously ill could have a *“duty to die and get out of the way”* of expensive medical technology so younger generations could thrive. [Ethikjournal AMA+1](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/against-duty-die/2014-05?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- He intended it as a **personal moral statement about quality of life and resource use**, not as a call for forced death or mass killing. Nonetheless, the phrasing has been taken as a kind of philosophical *senicide-like* argument.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧓 **3. Baroness Mary Warnock (Philosopher, UK)**

- British moral philosopher **Mary Warnock** caused controversy with remarks suggesting that people with dementia could be *allowed to elect euthanasia* if they felt they were a burden on family or society. [Ethikjournal AMA+1](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/against-duty-die/2014-05?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- While this is **not literally advocating killing old people**, it has been interpreted as endorsing a conditional “duty to die” based on societal burden — a slippery-slope argument critics link to senicide discourse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ⚖️ **4. Bioethics Debates Around “Duty to Die”**

- Some academic bioethicists (e.g., John Hardwig) have argued **theoretically** that under extreme circumstances there might be a *“duty to die”* for the elderly to reduce burdens. These arguments are **philosophical thought experiments**, not actual public policies or calls for forced killing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧠 **People Often Cited *But Not Advocating Senicide***

- **Philip Nitschke** and **Jack Kevorkian** are well-known advocates of *voluntary* euthanasia and assisted dying — that is, helping terminally ill or suffering individuals *choose to end their own lives*. But they did **not** publicly promote forced killing of old people for societal benefit. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Nitschke?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Other bioethicists like **Julian Savulescu** discuss the ethics of life and death choices, but not explicit senicide advocacy. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Savulescu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧠 **Context & Criticism**

- Most of these figures are **intensely controversial** and their statements are widely debated in ethical and public health circles.
- Directly advocating the killing of elderly people as a policy is *extremely rare* and almost universally condemned; what *does* appear more often are debates about voluntary euthanasia, end-of-life choices, quality of life, and healthcare resource allocation.
