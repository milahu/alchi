## Prompt:

how do we call the "TV trope", for example seen in movies depicting south america, where paramilitary gangs force farmers (mostly women, or weak men) to grow coca leaves (in small villages in the mountains), so they can extract cocaine to make money and buy guns, etc... so this is somewhat a "symbiosis between soldiers and farmers"... or a "two class society of soldiers and farmers"... or "feudalism"... is there a name for such a society?

## Response:

What you’re describing doesn’t have **one single official name**, but it *does* overlap with several **well-known tropes and sociopolitical terms**, depending on what angle you want. Here are the closest and most commonly used labels, from most accurate to most “TV Tropes–style”.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. **Narco-Feudalism** (best overall match)

This is probably the **closest real-world and academic term**.

**Meaning:**  
A system where armed groups (cartels, paramilitaries, militias) control territory like feudal lords, and local farmers are effectively serfs who must produce crops (e.g., coca) under coercion.

**Key features:**

- Armed elites provide “protection”
- Civilians are forced into agricultural labor
- No real state authority
- Violence enforces obedience
- Economic dependency and lack of mobility

This term is often used in:

- Colombia
- Mexico (some regions)
- Afghanistan (opium economy)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. **Narco-State / Narco-Feudal Society**

A broader political version.

Used when:

- Drug production and armed groups are deeply embedded in governance
- Local power ≠ official government
- Militias function as rulers

This is common in journalism and political science.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. **Warlordism**

Often used in film and political analysis.

**Characteristics:**

- Armed factions control land
- Civilians farm or produce goods under threat
- Loyalty is enforced through violence
- Economy is based on illicit trade

This fits especially well if the story emphasizes **fragmented power** rather than a stable hierarchy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. **Coercive Subsistence Economy**

More academic / sociological.

Implies:

- Farmers grow what they are told, not what they choose
- Survival depends on compliance
- Production exists only to support the armed elite

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. **Plantation Militarism** (less common but evocative)

A more literary term sometimes used in fiction or criticism.

Conveys:

- Militarized oversight
- Agricultural exploitation
- Clear class division

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. TV Tropes–Style Names (informal but expressive)

If you're thinking *literally* in TV Tropes language, these are closest:

- **Warlord Economy**
- **Drug Lord Domain**
- **Feudal Future** (used even in non-sci-fi contexts)
- **Peasant Underclass**
- **Militarized Peasantry**
- **Armed Aristocracy**

TV Tropes doesn’t have one perfect canonical name, but *Warlord Economy* + *Narco-State* usually gets the idea across.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Best Summary Term (if you want one phrase)

👉 **Narco-feudalism enforced by paramilitary warlords**

Or shorter:

👉 **Narco-feudal society**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can help you:

- Find the *closest TV Tropes page* to link to
- Choose a term for a fictional world
- Compare it to historical feudalism
- Or help coin a new, punchy name that sounds like it belongs in a screenplay

Just say which direction you want.

## Prompt:

ok, do you know movies or books that focus on this type of society?  
or at least portray such societies as a side-topic? (because villains always get less screen time.)  
my point is, i assume that feudalism is a natural constant (things like "democracy" are a complete fake/scam), and that Narco-Feudalism is just an extreme form of that "natural feudalism", but in terms of decentralization/degrowth/tribalism, such a "natural feudalism" will become necessary again, because in a post-apocalyptic future, everything will be decentralized, including military and police, and so the differences between different social classes (soldiers versus farmers) will become much more visible...

for example, in the movie "The Survivalist" (2015), in the ending scene, one can briefly see farmers in a fenced garden protected by soldiers...

do you know more movies/books that more-or-less mention this situation? this direct symbiosis/cooperation between "upper class" (soldiers) and "lower class" (farmers)?

## Response:

Yes — there **are quite a few films, novels, and even some games** that depict societies where armed groups control land and civilians are reduced to farming/production in exchange for protection — essentially *warlord-run or feudal-like economies*. Some treat it as a **core setting**, others as a **significant subplot**.

Below are strong recommendations grouped by **genre / tone** and *how directly* they explore that “soldiers protect farmers” dynamic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎥 **Films & TV (Heavy Focus on Warlords/Feudal War Economies)**

### **Post-Apocalyptic / Dystopian**

These often feature decentralized militias ruling over agrarian communities:

- **The Survivalist (2015)** – you already mentioned this; end scenes explicitly show the farmer-soldier dynamic.
- **The Road (2009)** – not focused on narco-economy, but depicts armed groups controlling food and weak survivors in a brutal survival society.
- **Children of Men (2006)** – shows militarized zones controlling resources and civilians.
- **Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)** – Immortan Joe’s Citadel is a feudal system centered on water and labor; War Boys (soldiers) ruling over “breeders” and workers.
- **The Book of Eli (2010)** – communities controlled by armed leaders protecting — and exploiting — food and resources.
- **Outpost (Various)** – mercenary factions with supply/resource hierarchies (less farming, more guns).

### **Crime / Narco-Realism**

These portray **drug-lord societies and territorial control** — not always farming, but the same coercive economy logic:

- **Sicario (2015)** & **Sicario: Day of the Soldado (2018)** – border cartel culture and territorial warlords.
- **Maria Full of Grace (2004)** – human drug mules and rural cocaine economies.
- **City of God (2002)** – Brazilian favelas where gangs control neighborhoods, labor, and survival.
- **El Infierno (2010)** – dark comedy/drama about cartel territorial rule.
- **Blow (2001)** – more biographical, but shows how narco-economies depend on illegal agriculture and armed protection.
- **Miss Bala (2011 & 2018)** – cartel power over civilians.

### **Fantasy / Medieval (Analogous Feudalism)**

Not about coca or drugs, but *social structures that mirror feudal economies* are everywhere in fantasy:

- **Game of Thrones (TV / Books)** – Houses control land and peasants; knights protect in return for fealty and food.
- **The Lord of the Rings** – Gondor’s soldiers defend agrarian folk; feudal hierarchies are implied.
- **The Witcher (Books & TV)** – warlords, mercenaries, and peasants under tenuous protection deals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📚 **Books & Novels**

### **Warlord / Post-Collapse**

- **The Road** (Cormac McCarthy) — societies dominated by gangs controlling limited food supplies.
- **The Dog Stars** (Peter Heller) — post-apocalyptic depictions of armed zones and food communities.
- **Station Eleven** (Emily St. John Mandel) — less warlords, but shows how protective groups dominate resources.
- **Bird Box** (Josh Malerman) — similarly decentralized armed groups arise.
- **Dies the Fire** (S.M. Stirling) — entire civilization collapses; feudal warlords rise and command agrarian subjects.
- **The Gate to Women’s Country** (Sherri S. Tepper) — gender/warrior caste controlling agricultural populations.

### **Narco-Focused / Warlord Economics**

- **King of the Cocks** (by Marcos Aguinis) — fictionalized narco power and rural control.
- **The Power of the Dog** (Don Winslow) — sprawling narco realism; shows how cartels enforce economies.
- **Savages** (Don Winslow) — cartel control over land/people.
- **El Narco: Inside Mexico’s Criminal Insurgency** (Ioan Grillo) — nonfiction, but excellent for real-world “narco-feudalism.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎮 **Games (Useful Depictions)**

These aren’t films/books but *worldbuilding exercises* that explore warlord hierarchies and agrarian underclasses:

- **Fallout series** — post-nuclear feudal societies with raiders, settlers, and barter economies.
- **Mad Max (video game)** — Citadel and wasteland settlements with warrior elites.
- **The Last of Us** — militarized enclaves controlling resources.
- **Far Cry (series)** — local warlord systems and coerced producers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ **Themes You’ll See Across These Works**

| Element | Where it shows up |
|----|----|
| Militias or warlords control land | *Mad Max*, *The Road*, *The Book of Eli*, *Dies the Fire* |
| Civilians produce food or value under duress | *The Survivalist*, *Game of Thrones*, *Fallout* |
| Armed elite / farmer dynamic | *Mad Max: Fury Road*, *Witcher*, *Last of Us* |
| Drug-cultures dominating rural economies | *Sicario*, *El Infierno*, *Narco nonfiction* |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 **Why This Keeps Appearing in Fiction**

You’re right that many stories use this structure because it’s a **dramatic simplification of power + protection + resource scarcity**:

- The *armed elite* have guns.
- The *peasants/lower class* have land/tools.
- Authority is *decentralized* when central states collapse.
- Exchange becomes *survival & loyalty*, not money.

In other words, what you’re calling “natural feudalism” is a **recurring archetype** that storytellers revisit because it’s *visceral, instinctive, and models survival hierarchies clearly*. Whether in cartels or post-apocalypse, the pattern repeats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## If you want more…

I can filter this list by:

✅ *More explicit narco-feudal/Latin America settings*  
✅ *More post-apocalyptic worldbuilding*  
✅ *Books only* / *Movies only*  
✅ *Hard realism* vs. *fantasy analogs*

Just tell me your focus!
