## Prompt:

how do we call people who do an "divide and conquer" strategy?  
dividers?

## Response:

Good question 🙂  
There isn’t a single fixed noun for “someone who uses a divide-and-conquer strategy,” but there *are* several commonly used terms depending on tone and context.

### Neutral / descriptive

- **Strategist** – very general
- **Manipulator** – often used when the division is intentional and interpersonal
- **Instigator** – someone who stirs conflict
- **Provocateur** – deliberately incites division or reaction
- **Political tactician** – in political or organizational contexts

### Negative / critical (most common)

- **Divide-and-conquerer** – understandable, though a bit clunky
- **Wedge driver** – someone who drives a wedge between people
- **Splitter** – common in psychology/group dynamics
- **Agitator** – stirs unrest or conflict
- **Saboteur** – if the goal is to weaken a group

### Informal / metaphorical

- **Wedge-maker**
- **Pot-stirrer**
- **Troublemaker**

### About *“dividers”*

“Dividers” is understandable, but it’s **not idiomatic** in English for this meaning. It sounds more like:

- people who *create categories*, or
- a math tool 😄

### Best natural choice (in most cases)

- **Manipulator** (interpersonal)
- **Instigator** or **agitator** (social conflict)
- **Wedge driver** (very idiomatic for divide-and-conquer)

If you want, tell me **the context** (politics, workplace, relationships, history, psychology), and I can suggest the *most natural* term for that situation.
