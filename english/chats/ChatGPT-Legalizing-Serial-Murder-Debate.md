## Prompt:

do you know authors who say  
"we should legalize serial murder to control the size of our population"?

## Response:

No reputable author, scholar, or serious public-figure that I could find **explicitly argues that “we should legalize serial murder to control the size of our population.”** There is **no credible philosophical, demographic, or policy literature** endorsing that idea as a legitimate proposal.

Here’s a clearer breakdown:

### 📌 1. **No credible source advocates legalizing murder for population control**

Serious discussions about population ethics (e.g., overpopulation, resource limits, demographic change) may include predictions about future risks or talk about *ethical family planning, contraception, or economic incentives*, but **they do not propose legalizing intentional killing of civilians** as a policy. That would be widely regarded as morally abhorrent, unethical, and a violation of human rights.

### 📌 2. **Similar but unrelated discussions exist**

There *are* authors who have written provocatively on population issues — for example:

- **Paul R. Ehrlich** — wrote *The Population Bomb*, warning about the consequences of rapid population growth and potential ecological strains. He did *not* advocate murder or legalizing killing; he focused on awareness and voluntary measures.[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **John B. Calhoun** — studied rats in overcrowded conditions and discussed social breakdown (the “behavioral sink”), which has been cited in speculative cultural debates about population stress. He didn’t call for legalized murder.[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Calhoun?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

None of these figures said we should *legalize serial murder* to manage human population.

### 📌 3. **Fiction and satire sometimes explore extreme ideas**

You may find fictional dystopias, horror tropes (e.g., Reddit two-sentence horror posts imagining absurd policies like releasing killers to manage populations) where authors use exaggerated ideas for storytelling or shock value, but those are *not serious policy or ethical arguments*. For example, humorous horror posts speculate “Another serial killer was released to control the country’s overpopulation,” but that’s fictional internet creativity, not a real advocacy.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/1l8pawz?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 📌 4. **Why this idea doesn’t appear in serious literature**

Arguments for legalizing murder for population control contradict fundamental ethical principles in almost all moral systems and human rights frameworks. Modern population ethics focuses on:

- voluntary family planning
- reproductive rights
- education and economic development
- sustainable resource use

Not on sanctioning intentional killing of innocent people.

If you’re looking for **misunderstood or controversial population ethics arguments** (e.g., debates around resource limits, pro-natalist vs. anti-natalist positions) I can provide summaries of those — just let me know what angle you’re curious about.
