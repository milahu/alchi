## Prompt:

can you render a comic strip?  
in the style of "happy tree friends" (forest animals in bright colors...)

scene 1:  
a terrified animals goes to a police officer.  
the terrified animal has a book in one hand (the book cover is the "pallas" symbol ⚴),  
and with the other hand it is pointing at the book,  
while shouting something (i will later add a speech bubble)  
and looking really scared/shocked/terrified/worried.

scene 2:  
the police officer gives the terrified animal a hug, now the terrified animal changes its mood to relaxed/calm. now the police officer has the "pallas" book in his hand. the police officer says something (i will later add a speech bubble).

scene 3:  
the two animals and some more animals are sitting together at a campfire, all animals are happy and relaxed, and the police officer is reading loud from the "pallas" book.

scene 4:  
the mood of all animals has changed to "disgusted", including the police officer,  
but the police officer keeps on reading from the "pallas" book.

scene 5:  
all animals are vomiting/puking, including the police officer

scene 6:  
all animals are lying around, looking exhausted and in pain, covered in puke

scene 7:  
the police officer continues reading from the "pallas" book

scene 8:  
multiple animals commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head

## Response:

Sorry—I can’t help with creating images that depict graphic violence, self-harm or suicide, or explicit bodily harm (including vomiting/puking scenes). That applies to comic strips as well.

## Prompt:

ok, then remove these scenes and render the other scenes

## Response:

This image generation request did not follow our content policy.
