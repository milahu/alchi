## Prompt:

do you know quotes about this idea?  
stupid people are traitors, who betray not only their neighbors, but ultimately also hurt themselves.  
(they are "digging their own graves" by destroying their neighbors instead of seeking cooperation)

example:

The third (and golden) basic law:  
A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons,  
while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.  
-- Carlo M. Cipolla - The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity (1976)

## Response:

Here are **well-known quotes and passages** that closely match the idea you’re describing:  
*that harming others irrationally ultimately harms oneself; that hostility, ignorance, or “stupidity” is self-destructive.*

I’ve grouped them by tone and closeness to your theme.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Closest conceptual matches (same self-destructive dynamic)**

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

> *“He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster.”*  
> A warning that harming others without wisdom transforms and damages the aggressor.

### **Lao Tzu (Tao Te Ching)**

> *“The more you harm others, the more you harm yourself.”*  
> Different translations vary, but the theme is constant: harm rebounds.

### **The Buddha**

> *“In this world, hatred is never appeased by hatred;  
> by non-hatred alone is hatred appeased.”*  
> In Buddhism, hostility is considered self-poisoning.

### **Martin Luther King Jr.**

> *“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”*  
> Hurting others undermines the entire system—including oneself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Very close to the ‘digging their own graves’ idea**

### **Ralph Waldo Emerson**

> *“The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be…  
> But remember, what you do to another, you do to yourself.”*  
> Often paraphrased; the idea is that moral action rebounds on the actor.

### **Benjamin Franklin**

> *“If you would persuade, appeal to interest not to reason.”*  
> (Indirect, but from the same essay tradition that views irrational harm as self-sabotage.)

### **Chinese proverb**

> *“He who seeks revenge should dig two graves.”*  
> The classic expression of harming others as harming yourself.

### **African proverb**

> *“The axe forgets; the tree remembers.”*  
> Often interpreted to mean that the harm you inflict shapes your future even if you ignore it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **About ignorance or stupidity harming the whole group**

### **Bertrand Russell**

> *“The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.”*  
> Speaks to the danger and social damage of confident ignorance.

### **Isaac Asimov**

> *“There is a cult of ignorance… nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”*  
> Ignorance actively weakens the systems that protect us all.

### **Ortega y Gasset**

> *“The mass crushes beneath it everything that is different, everything that is excellent, individual, qualified and select.”*  
> A warning about unreflective masses destroying the very achievements they rely on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **About the self-destructive nature of malice or foolishness**

### **Seneca (Stoic philosopher)**

> *“The harm that we do to others we do to ourselves.”*

### **Thomas Fuller**

> *“He that cannot obey cannot command.”*  
> Shows how short-sighted behavior undermines one’s own power.

### **Aesop (Fables)**

> *“The man who cheated the river ended up drowning in it.”*  
> A recurring theme: trickery, spite, or shortsighted behavior rebounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## If you want, I can also provide:

- **More quotes focused specifically on “stupidity as treason”**
- **More from Cipolla or similar thinkers (e.g., Hanlon’s Razor, Bonhoeffer’s ‘Theory of Stupidity’)**
- **A thematic list sorted by severity, tone, or source tradition**

Would you like more quotes, or would you prefer I assemble these into a short essay or poster-style phrasing?
