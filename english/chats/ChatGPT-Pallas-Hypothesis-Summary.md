## Prompt:

can you summarize this book?

<https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html>

the author describes his "pallas hypothesis" in the first half of the book  
but in the second half of the book he gets lost in offtopic content (concepts, quotes)  
i am only interested in the first half, in the "pallas hypothesis"

## Response:

Here’s a **focused summary of *only the first half* of the book *Pallas – Who Are My Friends?* — the part where the author describes his *Pallas hypothesis* (group-composition hypothesis based on personality types)**. I *omit the later off-topic quotes and conceptual content you said you’re not interested in*. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📘 **Summary of the “Pallas Hypothesis” (First Half)**

### **Core Question**

The author asks a deceptively simple question:

> **Who are my friends — and how should people connect so that everyone can freely use their strengths and delegate their weaknesses to friends?** [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

He argues that psychology and social science still don’t answer this in a systematic way, so *we have to find our own answer*. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 **Main Hypothesis (Pallas Pattern)**

### **1) Everyone Has Friends According to a Fixed Pattern**

The author proposes that:

- Every person needs **a specific set of friends**.
- These friends follow a precise geometric/structural pattern called the **Pallas pattern**. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

This pattern is meant to *explain how to connect people so that relationships are stable and compatible*. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 👥 **What Determines Friend Compatibility?**

Compatibility between people is not random but determined by:

- **Personality type**, defined by a combination of *inner gender* and *inner age*.
- The author suggests each person has a type and that *the right combination of types determines stable friendship bonds*. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

Personality type is described in a structured way (16 types total), with specific roles, but the key point is:

> **Compatibility stems from structural relationships of personality types, not random or subjective preferences.** [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 **Structure of the Pallas Pattern**

In the pattern:

- People are arranged in a grid of **16 personality positions**.
- Each person has **four direct friends**: two along one direction and two along another (horizontal + vertical), based on structural rules in the pattern. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)
- “Common” or *indirect friends* are formed diagonally. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

The pattern can be visualized like a repeating tile — *close positions are friendships; distant ones are non-friends/enemies*. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 **Key Assumptions of the Hypothesis**

The theory rests on several explicit assumptions:

### 1. **People are fundamentally different**

Differences include *gender, age, and personality type*. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

### 2. **Personality type determines compatibility**

> A person is compatible with another if **their personality type lives in a “correctly matched” body and mind**. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

### 3. **Compatibility is objective and structural**

The author is trying to find a *mathematically exact and universally applicable pattern* for relationships, not just a folk-psychology list. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 **Underlying Idea**

The Pallas pattern isn’t just a social map — it’s meant to be a \*\*general theory for:

- Stable groups
- Self-organization
- Tribal relations
- Decentralized societies\*\*

… built on *personality compatibility*, not coercion or imposed systems. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 **Intended Application**

According to the author, if the hypothesis is true:

- People could organize their lives and societies around compatible structures.
- *Friends would be placed close and enemies distant*, minimizing misunderstandings and conflict. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

The central thesis:  
📌 **Stable human relations follow a structural pattern based on personality types — the Pallas pattern.** [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 **How the Hypothesis Was Developed**

The author says the pattern came from:

- Personal observation of friends and people he likes vs dislikes.
- Seeking symmetry and consistency in these relations to derive a structured pattern. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 **Summary of Main Points**

✔ People need specific friends based on personality compatibility.  
✔ Compatibility comes from a structural pattern (the *Pallas pattern*).  
✔ The pattern is universal and repeatable.  
✔ This could form the basis for stable human groups. [milahu.github.io](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can also extract the **actual visual pattern and diagram relationships** from the book and explain them in simpler terms (e.g., what each of the 16 positions represents and how to interpret the friend links). Would you like that?

Do you like this personality?
