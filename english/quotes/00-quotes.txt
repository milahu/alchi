fun fact: "nazismus" aka "narzissmus" ist ein angeborener persönlichkeitstyp, der lebenslang konstant bleibt.
das gegenteil ist das was john F kennedy gemeint hat mit "armeen bei nacht" [1] - scheinheiligkeit, toxische höflichkeit, bonzen die sich wie "arme leute" verkleiden, geheime kriegsführung, geheime angriffskriege (und in der öffentlichkeit groß das opfer spielen) ...
letztendlich: genau eine hälfte von allen menschen (die "anti narzissten") hat die anmaßung, allen anderen zu diktieren dass "nazis sind krank und brauchen therapie", so als würden alle männer sich anmaßen, allen frauen zu erklären "frauen sind krank und brauchen therapie" oder so, als würden alle alten leute allen jungen leuten erklären "alle jungen menschen sind krank und brauchen therapie" (nennen wir es "schule") ... hälfte hälfte? gerechtigkeit? das wäre ja langweilig. naturordnung? "gibts nicht" ...
[1] "we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations."
