if you love then let go
if you fear then hold on

mind game:

our family has one crazy child.
what shall we do? let go or hold on?

this question is a personality test
just like any other "critical" issue.

but the question is not complete yet.

we assume there is a second family.
that whole family is crazy in our eyes,
but they have one child that is not crazy.
we call that child "the foreign child".

so, what shall we do with our crazy child?

"let go" means:
1. we let our crazy child live with the crazy family
2. we allow the foreign child to live with us

"hold on" means:
1. we force our crazy child to stay with us
2. we refuse the foreign child to join our family
