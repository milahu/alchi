Another intricacy that emerged from the study 
of the dark side of interpersonal communication 
involves arguing and fighting. 

By and large, arguments between friends or spouses 
are generally thought of as a negative event. 

However, research in this field shed light 
on the age-old adage that “it’s not what you argue about, it’s how you argue.” 

Research further yielded that couples, both romantic and platonic, 
who argue with a purpose and do not devolve into fights filled with ad hominin attacks, 
actually better manage their relationships. 

Moreover, an argument will often involve forgiveness and reconciliation, 
which may ultimately strengthen the relationship. 

While “fighting” in relationships is negative, research continues to show 
that “arguing,” when done properly, is a positive force. 

Scholars continue to examine these “gray areas” in interpersonal communication, 
which have relevance in the improvement of social bonds at both the personal and the greater societal levels.
