the reaper sits at the town's gate
a priest comes along, and sits down next to him.

the priest asks: what are you doing here?
the reaper says: i want to visit the city and take 100 lives.

the priest runs into the city and screams in panic:
the reaper is coming and he wants to take 100 lives!

the citizens panic, run home and lock their doors for many weeks.
5000 people die.

as the priest wants to leave town, the reaper is still sitting there.
the priest says full of anger:
you wanted 100 lives, but you took 5000!

the reaper says: i took only 100 - sick and old people, like every week.
the other lives were taken by fear, the fear that you created.
