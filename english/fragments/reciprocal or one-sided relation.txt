reciprocal or one-sided relation



2.2 Theory of Interpersonal Relationship

According to Social Exchange theory proposed by George Casper Homans in the year 1958, “give and
take” forms the basis of almost all relationships though their proportions may vary as per the intensity of the
relationship. 

In a relationship, every individual has expectations from his/her partner. A relationship without
expectations is meaningless. 

According to Social Exchange Theory feelings and emotions ought to be
reciprocated for a successful and long lasting relationship. Relationships can never be one sided. An individual
invests his time and energy in relationships only when he gets something out of it. 

There are relationships where
an individual receives less than he gives. 

This theory becomes necessary to organisations because it takes two or
more people to form a team and a team cannot exist without “give and take” which is the core of any
relationship. Therefore, this theory emphasises the need for positive interpersonal relationship among
organisation’s members in other to achieve its goals.

Defining Interpersonal Communication

Defining interpersonal communication is no easy task. 
While most scholars cannot agree on one single definition, 
there is a general consensus that interpersonal communication 
is the sharing of meaning and messages between people 
who share some level of interdependence. 

This meaning can be shared in-person, 
via a computer-mediated channel, 
or through audio or mobile technologies, 

and it can be verbal or nonverbal in nature.

While interpersonal communication research 
is usually focused on interactions between two people, 
there are some cases of high intimacy and interdependence 
that extend this definition to a small group (e.g., a nuclear family).
