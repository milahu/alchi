People that self-identify as liberals, for example, 
were more likely to face the camera directly, 
and were more likely to express “surprise” in their pictures. 

Conservatives, meanwhile, on top of being on the whole more white, male, and old, 
also ended up expressing more “disgust” in their photos than their liberal counterparts.

--> optimist vs pessimist, idealist vs realist



Studies focusing on the objective characteristics of human faces 
have found some associations between facial morphology and personality features. 

For instance, facial symmetry predicts extraversion9. 

Another widely studied indicator is the facial width to height ratio (fWHR), 
which has been linked to various traits, such as 
achievement striving10, deception11, dominance12, 
aggressiveness13,14,15,16, and risk-taking17. 
The fWHR can be detected with high reliability irrespective of facial hair. 
The accuracy of fWHR-based judgements suggests that the human perceptual system 
may have evolved to be sensitive to static facial features, such as the relative face width18.

Trait intercorrelations

The structure of the correlations between the scales 
was generally similar for the observed test scores and the predicted values, 
but some coefficients differed significantly (based on the z test) (see Table 3). 

Most notably, predicted openness was more strongly associated 
with conscientiousness (negatively) and extraversion (positively), 

[ high openness ~ low conscientiousness ]
[ high openness ~ high extraversion ]
[ --> openness = extraversion versus conscientiousness ]

whereas its [openness] association with agreeableness was negative rather than positive. 
[ high openness ~ low agreeableness ]

The associations of predicted agreeableness with conscientiousness and neuroticism 
were stronger than those between the respective observed scores.
