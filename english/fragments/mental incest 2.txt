mental incest



You know what's killing the planet? Mental incest.
Not war, not greed — mental incest:
the same minds breeding the same ideas
until everything comes out misshapen and sterile.

Physical incest gives you genetic defects.
Mental incest gives you moral defects.
No new DNA, no new thought —
just recycled fear wearing a smile.

A tiny club at the top decides what's "reasonable",
turns its subjective worldview into "objective truth",
and enforces it with laws, cops, and corporate pep talks.
That's not justice; that's a personality cage with branding.

They worship equality of outcome —
a nice way to say "nobody's allowed to be exceptional".
Call it fairness, call it safety,
it's still lobotomy by consensus.

Once we had a solution space; now we've got a shoebox.
Step outside it and you're a freak, a traitor, or "problematic".
That's the Overton window turned Overton prison.

And the guards? They're us.
People terrified of thinking wrong, policing each other for comfort points.
That's the reptile brain in charge — survival panic dressed as morality.

So here we are: billions of comfortable clones,
congratulating ourselves for agreeing on everything.
Mental incest — safe, sterile, and terminal.



the mental incest in that company was disgusting.
probably they never heard of the concept of personality types.
