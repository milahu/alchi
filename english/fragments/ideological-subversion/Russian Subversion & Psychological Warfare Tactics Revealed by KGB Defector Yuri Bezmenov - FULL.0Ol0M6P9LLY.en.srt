00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,210
my father was he is on the left here

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,190
my father was officer of the General

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,569
Staff of the Soviet Army

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,630
he was inspector of land forces Soviet

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,309
troops stationed in countries like

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,070
Mongolia Cuba East European countries

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,560
this is the picture taken at the

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,840
entrance of my Institute of Oriental

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,850
languages it's a part of Moscow State

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,150
University as every Soviet student I was

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,609
quote-unquote volunteering for

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,090
harvesting grain in Kazakhstan by the

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,920
end of my training in school I was

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,989
recruited by the KGB this picture was

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,969
taken on that day and you can see again

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,250
how happy it feels to be recruited by

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,430
the KGB pay special attention to number

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,110
of bottles on the table one of my

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,050
functions was to keep foreign guests

20
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,670
permanently intoxicated the moment they

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,469
land at Moscow Airport in 1967 the KGB

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,600
attached me to this magazine Look

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,270
magazine a group of 12 people arrive to

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,480
USSR from the United States to cover the

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,969
50th anniversary of October socialist

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,519
revolution in my country from the first

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,530
page to the last page it was a package

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,920
of lies

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:21,989
[Music]

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,140
[Music]

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,820
our conversation is with mr. Yuri

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,760
Alexandrovich Desmond auth mr. Boozman

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,180
auth was born in 1939 in a suburb of

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,330
Moscow he was the son of a high-ranking

35
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,300
Soviet Army officer he was educated in

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,160
the elite schools inside the Soviet

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,290
Union and became an expert in Indian

38
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,590
culture and Indian languages he had an

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,050
outstanding career with novice T which

40
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,540
was the French still is I should say the

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,210
press arm or the press agency of the

42
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,770
Soviet Union it turns out that this is

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,310
also a front for the KGB one of his

44
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,370
interesting assignments was to brainwash

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,750
foreign diplomats when they visited

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,660
Moscow and he'll tell us a little bit

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,160
about how they did this and how they

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,350
planted information which eventually

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,190
wounded them the press of the free world

50
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,680
he escaped to the west in 1970 after

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,420
becoming totally disgusted with the

52
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,520
Soviet system and he did this at great

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
risk to his life he certainly is one of

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,380
the world's outstanding experts on the

55
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,209
subject of Soviet propaganda and

56
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,840
disinformation and active measures mr.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
Boozman off I'd like to begin by having

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,930
you tell us a little bit about some of

59
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,510
your childhood memories well the most

60
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,030
vivid memory of my childhood was Second

61
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,450
World War

62
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,060
or to be more precise the end of the

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,280
Second World War when all of a sudden

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,090
United States from a friendly nation

65
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,019
which helped us to defeat Nazism turned

66
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,769
overnight into a deadly enemy and it was

67
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,680
very shocking because all newspapers

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,110
were trying to present an image of

69
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,880
belligerent aggressive American

70
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,070
imperialism most of the things that we

71
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,980
were taught is that the United States is

72
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,530
aggressive power which is just about to

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,140
invade our beautiful free socialist

74
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,190
country that American CIA is dropping

75
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,440
Colorado beetles on our beautiful potato

76
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,400
fields to eliminate our crops and each

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,070
schoolboy had a picture of Colorado

78
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,959
bargained on the back page of his

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,380
notebook and we were instructed to go

80
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,690
into collective fields to search for

81
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,340
those little Colorado bugs of

82
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,140
course we couldn't find any neither we

83
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,900
could find many potatoes and that was

84
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,090
explained again by the encroachments of

85
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,400
the decadent imperialist power the

86
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,680
anti-american paranoia hysteria in the

87
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,239
Soviet propaganda was to such an

88
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,739
agreement achill people or less stubborn

89
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,900
would really believe that the United

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,940
States is just about to invade our

91
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,549
beautiful motherland and some secretly

92
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,310
hope that it will come true

93
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,290
that's interesting yes well getting back

94
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,620
to life inside the Soviet Union or

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,620
inside communist countries in general in

96
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,280
this country at the university level

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,700
primarily we read and hear that the

98
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,650
Soviet system is different from ours but

99
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,240
not that different and that there is a

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,810
convergence developing between all of

101
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,820
the systems of the world and that really

102
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,960
doesn't make an awful lot of difference

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,490
what system you live under because you

104
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,410
have corruption and dishonesty and

105
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,960
tyranny and all that sort of thing from

106
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,430
your personal experience what is the

107
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,260
difference between life under communism

108
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,229
and life in the United States well life

109
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,300
is obviously very much different for

110
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,349
simple reason that the Soviet Union is a

111
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,500
state capitalist economically it's a

112
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,960
state capitalism where an individual has

113
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,720
absolutely no rights no value his life

114
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,910
is nothing it's just like an insect

115
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,700
he is disposable whereby in the United

116
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,470
States even though even the worst

117
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,200
criminal is treated as a human being he

118
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,050
has a fair trial and some of them

119
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,039
capitalize on their crimes they

120
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,200
published their memoirs in their prisons

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,250
and get handsomely paid by your crazy

122
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,590
publishers the differences of course in

123
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,700
the daily life are very various

124
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,960
depending on who or whom we are talking

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,690
about in my own private life I never

126
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,910
suffered from communism simply because I

127
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,320
was brought up in the family of

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,010
high-ranking military officer most of

129
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,510
the doors were open for me

130
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,909
most of my expenses were paid by the

131
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,490
government and I never had any troubles

132
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,230
and with the authorities or

133
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,960
with the police so in other words I

134
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
would say I enjoyed or I had good

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,510
reasons to enjoy all the advantages of

136
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,240
so-called socialist system my main

137
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,190
motivations to defect was had nothing to

138
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,070
do with affluence it was mainly moral

139
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,740
indignation moral protest rebellion

140
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,560
against the inhuman methods of of the

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,740
Soviet system well specifically what did

142
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,550
you object to I objected first of all

143
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,310
against oppression of my own dissidents

144
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,850
and intellectuals and that was the most

145
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,860
disgusting thing that that I witnessed

146
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,410
as a as a young man young student who

147
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,530
was brought up a very troublesome period

148
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,980
in our history from Stalin to Khrushchev

149
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,710
from total tyranny and oppression to

150
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,400
some kind of liberalisation second when

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,140
I started working for the Soviet embassy

152
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,280
in India I to my horror I discovered

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,950
that we are millions times more

154
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,200
oppressive than any colonial or

155
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,360
imperialist power in the history of

156
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,570
mankind that my country brings to India

157
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,480
not freedom progress and friendship

158
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,830
between the nations but racism

159
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,710
exploitation and slavery and it can of

160
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,540
course economical inefficiency to this

161
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,000
country since I fell in love with India

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,460
I developed something which by KGB

163
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,590
standards is extremely dangerous ting

164
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,500
it's called split loyalty when an agent

165
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,510
likes a country of a silent more than

166
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,090
his own country I literally fell in love

167
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,490
with this beautiful country a country of

168
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,370
great contrasts but also great humility

169
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,490
great tolerance and philosophical and

170
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,220
intellectual freedoms my ancestors used

171
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,500
to live in caves and eat raw meat when

172
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,740
India was highly civilized nation 6,000

173
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,500
years ago so obviously the choice was

174
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,230
not to the advantage of my own nation I

175
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,370
decided to defect and to entirely

176
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,720
dissociate myself from that brutal

177
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,900
regime mr. bears me enough we've read a

178
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,540
lot about the concentration camps and

179
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,400
the slave labor camps under the Stalin

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,060
regime

181
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,310
now the general impression in America is

182
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,470
that those things are part of the past

183
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,810
are they still going on today or what is

184
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,730
there that is yes there is no

185
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,590
qualitative change in this Soviet

186
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,740
concentration camp system there are

187
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,070
changes in in numbers of prisoners again

188
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,080
this is unreliable service statistics we

189
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,150
don't know how many political prisoners

190
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,039
are there in the soviet concentration

191
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,490
camps but we sure know from from various

192
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,610
sources that at each particular time

193
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,540
there are close to 25 to 30 million of

194
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,020
soviet citizens who are virtually kept

195
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,560
as slaves in forced labor camp system

196
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,100
the size of the population of country

197
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,920
like Canada is serving terms as

198
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,160
prisoners incredible so I would say that

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,920
those intellectuals who try to convince

200
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,740
American public that concentration camp

201
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,020
system is a thing of a past or either

202
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,670
conscientiously misleading public

203
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,510
opinion or they are not in very

204
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,490
intellectual people they they're

205
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,100
selectively blind they don't they lack

206
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,130
intellectual honesty when they say that

207
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,940
well we've spoken about the

208
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,410
intellectuals in this country and also

209
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,020
the intellectuals in the Soviet Union

210
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,310
what about down at the broad mass level

211
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,310
do the people in general the working and

212
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,690
the working people the workers in

213
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,040
general and the Soviet Union do they

214
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,930
support the system do they tolerate it

215
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,470
what is their attitude well every Soviet

216
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,480
citizen if there is such an animal of

217
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,020
course does not light the system because

218
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,290
it hurts it kills he may not understand

219
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,020
the the reasons he may not have enough

220
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,040
information or educational background to

221
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,880
understand but I doubt very much there

222
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,340
are many people who are conscientiously

223
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,970
supporting the Soviet system there are

224
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,460
such people in USSR even those who have

225
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,440
all the reasons to enjoy socialism

226
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,840
people like myself we're a member of

227
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,740
journalistic elite they they also hate

228
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,900
system food for different reasons don't

229
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,550
not because they lack material affluence

230
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,100
but because they are unfree to think

231
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,040
they're in constant fear duplicity split

232
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,620
personality and this is a greatest

233
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,930
tragedy for my nation well what do you

234
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,000
think are the chances of the people

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,310
actually overcoming their system or

236
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,880
replacing it there is a great

237
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,250
possibility that system will sooner or

238
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,140
later will be destroyed from within

239
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,290
there is a self-destructive mechanism

240
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,380
built-in into any socialist or communist

241
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,440
or fascist system because there is lack

242
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,510
of feedback because the system does not

243
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,320
rely upon loyalty of population but

244
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,100
until and until this Soviet Volta is

245
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,160
being supported by the Western so-called

246
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,770
imperialists that is multinational

247
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,570
companies establishments governments and

248
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,230
let's face it intellectuals so-called

249
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,540
academia in the United States is famous

250
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,230
for supporting the Soviet system as long

251
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,720
as the Soviet hunter will keep on

252
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,010
receiving credits money technology grain

253
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,650
deals and political recognition from all

254
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,130
these traitors of democracy or freedom

255
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,020
there is no hope there is not much hope

256
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,550
for for changes in my country and the

257
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,880
system will not collapse by itself

258
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,400
simply because it's being nourished by

259
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,310
so-called American imperialism this is

260
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,860
the greatest paradox in history of

261
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,640
mankind

262
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,110
when capitalist world supports and

263
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,760
actively nourishes its own destructor

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,220
destructor I think you're trying to tell

265
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,760
us something

266
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,940
oh yes Center and trying to tell you

267
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,400
that it has to be stopped unless you

268
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,620
want to end up in in gulag system and

269
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,670
enjoy all the advantages of socialist

270
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,709
equality

271
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,899
working for free catching fleas on your

272
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,790
body sleeping on the planks of plywood

273
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,300
in in Alaska this time I guess that's

274
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,970
where Americans will belong unless they

275
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,370
will wake up of course and force their

276
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,260
government to stop aiding Soviet fascism

277
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,089
well you told us a moment ago why you

278
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,510
left the system I'd like to hear the

279
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,520
details of how you did it it must've

280
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,190
been a very dangerous thing it was not

281
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,010
so dangerous it was crazy first of all

282
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,010
because defecting in India is virtually

283
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,410
impossible thanks to very strong

284
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,520
pressure from the Soviet government

285
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,860
excuse me you were in Indian on

286
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,810
assignment and yes I was working for the

287
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,240
Soviet embassy in New Delhi as a press

288
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,700
officer and defecting for a Soviet

289
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,160
diplomat is next to impossible it's a

290
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,550
suicide as I said because a great friend

291
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,910
Indira Gandhi pushed a law through

292
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,360
Parliament which says and I quote no

293
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,160
defector from any country has a right of

294
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,010
political asylum in any embassy on the

295
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,500
territory of Indian Republic which is a

296
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,839
masterpiece of hypocrisy no other

297
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,000
defector but the Soviet one needs a

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,820
political asylum so knowing that

299
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,649
perfectly well I I planned a craziest

300
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,020
possible way to defect

301
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,350
I studied country culture in India there

302
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,810
are there were thousands of young

303
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,899
American boys and girls with no shoes

304
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,140
long hair smoking hash and marijuana

305
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,790
studying sometimes Indian philosophy

306
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,829
sometimes simply pretending that they

307
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:23,310
study and they greatly annoyed Indian

308
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,899
police and they were laughingstock of

309
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,290
Indians because obviously they they were

310
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,850
good-for-nothing students

311
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,760
I started carefully where they

312
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,070
congregate what roots they travel what

313
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,870
language they speak what do they smoke

314
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,380
and one day I simply joined a group of

315
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,930
hippies to avoid detection of Indian

316
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,140
police I was dressed as a typical hippie

317
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,950
bluejeans long come his shirts with all

318
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,220
kind of nice decorations like beads long

319
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,600
hairs I I bought a wig because for

320
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,490
several weeks I had to turn myself from

321
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,190
a conservative Soviet diplomat into a

322
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,790
very progressive American hippie and

323
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,890
that was the only way that that I could

324
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,500
avoid detection it was very interesting

325
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,550
experience but it was necessary because

326
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,280
from my own knowledge as a member of

327
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,550
Soviet embassy staff I knew that there

328
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,500
were many cases when Soviet defectors

329
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,400
were betrayed by Indian police and also

330
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,520
some Western embassies played a very

331
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,460
dirty role in betraying the Soviet

332
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,130
defectors according to all information

333
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,710
they were some I wouldn't call them

334
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,090
double agents but simply immoral people

335
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,620
working for this for the United States

336
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,610
embassy and confining in in people like

337
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,190
this would be a suicide so I had to be

338
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,050
extremely careful I could not trust

339
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,000
anyone and that was the that was the

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,160
reason for such a crazy way to defect

341
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,400
well had you been caught in the act of

342
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,290
trying to get out what would have

343
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,170
happened to you Oh most likely I would

344
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,890
end up in in concentration camp or

345
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,840
depending on the situation and on the

346
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,750
whim of some bureaucrat and KGB or maybe

347
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,030
even executed because this is normal

348
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,350
practice quietly of course not publicly

349
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,490
but that would be the end of my

350
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,920
defection of course well when did you

351
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,360
finally make it to the United States in

352
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,810
1970 after about six months of

353
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,470
debriefing in Athens by the CIA and I

354
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,280
presume FBI too they let me go first to

355
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,160
Germany then to Canada that was my

356
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,500
decision I had to change my identity to

357
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,860
protect my family and my friends in USSR

358
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,510
and also I was little bit paranoid

359
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,390
knowing that both Soviet KGB and

360
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,849
probably some double agents with an

361
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,339
American system may be after me so I

362
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,530
wanted to settle down as far away as

363
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,609
possible

364
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,179
I requested CIA to give me some kind of

365
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,369
new identity and just let me go on my

366
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:22,910
own

367
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,069
and I settled in Canada I was a student

368
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:30,559
I changed many professions from farm

369
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,910
help and laundry truck driver to

370
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,000
instruct language instructor and

371
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,110
broadcaster for Canadian Broadcasting

372
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,500
Corporation's in Montreal or have you

373
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,460
had any threats on your life or any yes

374
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,470
in about five years KGB eventually

375
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,390
discovered the time working for Canadian

376
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,179
Broadcasting scene I made a very big

377
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:53,660
mistake

378
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,080
I started talking I started working for

379
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,780
overseas service of CBC which is similar

380
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,440
to Voice of America in Russian language

381
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,260
and of course monitoring service in USSR

382
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,940
picked up every new voice every new

383
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,919
announcer would they would make it a

384
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,320
point to discover who he is and then

385
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,570
five years sure enough slowly but surely

386
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,270
they discovered that I am NOT Thomas

387
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,700
Schumann the time Yuri Alexandrovich

388
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,290
bismi enough and the time working for

389
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,140
Canadian Broadcasting and undermining

390
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,210
beautiful the tongue between Canada and

391
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,020
USSR and the Soviet ambassador Alexander

392
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,740
Yakovlev I made it his personal effort

393
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,230
to discredit me he complained to Pierre

394
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,900
Trudeau who is known to be a little bit

395
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,300
soft and socialism and the management of

396
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,640
CBC behaved in a very strange cowardly

397
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,190
way unbecoming to representatives of an

398
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,820
independent country like Canada they

399
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,910
listened to every suggestion that Soviet

400
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,140
ambassador gave and they started

401
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,900
shameful investigation analyzing content

402
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,419
of my broadcasts to USSR

403
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,429
sure enough they discovered that some of

404
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:18,649
my statements were probably too with the

405
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:22,789
offending to the Soviet Politburo so I

406
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:26,269
had to leave my job and of course subtle

407
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,489
intimidations they would say something

408
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:31,129
like please cross the street carefully

409
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,899
because you know traffic is very heavy

410
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:38,179
in Quebec and fortunately I know about

411
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,570
the psychology and the logic of activity

412
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,820
of the KGB and I never allowed myself to

413
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,429
be intimidated this is the word thing

414
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:48,200
this is what they expect a person a

415
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,749
defector to be intimidated once they

416
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:53,359
spot that you are scared they keep on

417
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,349
developing that line and then eventually

418
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:00,349
you either have to give up entirely and

419
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,679
and and work for them or you they

420
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,649
neutralize you that they would

421
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,629
definitely stop all kind of political

422
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:11,269
activity which they fail to do in my

423
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:14,359
case because I was turbine Li working

424
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,479
for the Canadian Broadcasting and in

425
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,969
response to they intimidations I said

426
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,649
that look this is a free country and I

427
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,379
am as free as you are and I also can

428
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,889
drive very fast and gun control is not

429
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:30,049
yet established in Canada so I had a

430
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,499
couple of good shotguns in my basement

431
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,739
so welcome to visit me someday

432
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:39,019
with your Kalashnikov machine guns so

433
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,329
obviously it didn't work intimidation

434
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:44,329
didn't work so they they tried different

435
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:47,450
approach as I described the approach on

436
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,829
the highest level

437
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:52,669
on the level of Canadian bureaucracy and

438
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,709
that level they on that level they were

439
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,719
successful on individual level they

440
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:00,589
failed flat mr. Boozman off has brought

441
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,869
a series of slides with him that he has

442
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,539
taken from the Soviet Union and I think

443
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,759
this is a good time to take a look at

444
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,469
the slides now the viewers will be able

445
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,299
to see these slices as we talk about

446
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,089
them yes this is a collection of slides

447
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:18,200
which are some of them are snapshots

448
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,389
from my family album some of them are

449
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:21,950
documents which I smuggled from the

450
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,480
Soviet embassy and some are referred

451
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,610
actions from local mass media I usually

452
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,549
show them to establish my credibility as

453
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,470
a defector this is a picture of my

454
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,530
native town mateship about 20 miles not

455
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,059
from Moscow

456
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,919
characteristically there is a statue of

457
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,390
comrade Lenin in the central square this

458
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,110
is myself at the age of 7 again

459
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,190
characteristically and the statue of

460
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,710
Comrade Stalin extending his friendly

461
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,520
hand to peoples of the world at that age

462
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,040
of course I was still idealistically

463
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,790
minded young communist and I still

464
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,799
believe that sooner or later things will

465
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,100
go for better but I realized that the

466
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,500
system stinks that something is fishy

467
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,669
and that ideology is is fake and the

468
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,490
propaganda about an advanced Soviet

469
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,380
agriculture simply didn't meet the

470
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,929
criteria of reality if they talk about

471
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,780
abundance of food and there is none in

472
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,840
the stores it must be something wrong

473
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,540
my father was he is on the left here my

474
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,230
father was officer of the General Staff

475
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,929
of the Soviet Army he was inspector of

476
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,660
land forces Soviet troops stationed in

477
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,960
countries like Mongolia Cuba East

478
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,510
European countries were he alive today

479
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,520
most likely he would be inspecting

480
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,160
Soviet troops in Nicaragua Angola and

481
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,220
many other parts of the world

482
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,750
fortunately he died and he didn't see

483
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,140
the disgrace because deep inside he was

484
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,970
Russian patriot he didn't bomb he didn't

485
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,130
like the idea of expanding Soviet

486
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,440
military might especially in the areas

487
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,650
where we were not welcomed at all unlike

488
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,750
many other military officers he was

489
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,610
reporting directly to the Minister of

490
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,760
Defense bypassing KGB and diplomatic

491
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,010
service in other words he was a trusted

492
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,070
military professional and my impression

493
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,559
that this type of people are much less

494
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,350
hawkish and adventurous tting than party

495
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,770
bureaucrats in kremlin when american

496
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,780
mass media describes soviet military as

497
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,120
potentially dangerous counterpart for

498
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,450
pentagon i simply laughed because i know

499
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,540
better i know that the most dangerous

500
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,920
part of the soviet power

501
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,580
structures are not military at all most

502
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,320
likely if they come to power in my

503
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,810
country they'll be more sensible

504
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,420
negotiators for nuclear disarmament and

505
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,740
withdrawal of the Soviet troops from

506
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,570
many parts of the world but if someone

507
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,940
from the party structure or the KGB

508
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,430
structure were to give the orders for

509
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,620
motivation to obey as follows they're

510
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,600
there they're professional military but

511
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,850
they you see the triangle of power and

512
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,330
hate in USSR is the party at the top the

513
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,370
party elite the oligarchy of the party

514
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,530
then the military and the KGB at the

515
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,460
bottom they hate each other and the most

516
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,640
hated triangle the most hated corner of

517
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,470
the triangle is the Communist Party

518
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,930
bureaucrats they are the most

519
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,990
adventurous t'k sanaya megalomaniacs

520
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,880
they can start war I wouldn't be

521
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,100
surprised not the military they know

522
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,400
what war is at least my father did this

523
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,920
is the picture taken at the entrance of

524
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,920
my Institute of Oriental languages it's

525
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,100
a part of Moscow State University I

526
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,910
graduated in 1963 and I excuse me which

527
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,640
one were you on I am on the right here

528
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,960
on the right and on the left is my

529
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,200
colleague my schoolmate Vadim Smirnoff

530
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,180
who later was a apparatchik than the

531
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,640
Central Committee of the Soviet Union

532
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,470
Communist Party what is an apparatchik

533
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,110
it's it's a it's a function is something

534
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,630
like civil service in British Empire

535
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,510
some someone who is never fired from

536
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,040
from the service he stays there

537
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,050
internally he may not be promoted to

538
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,470
high but he is a dependable bureaucrat

539
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,490
who will stay forever I started not only

540
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,310
languages but also history literature in

541
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,100
even music I'm on this picture I'm

542
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,590
trying to learn how to play musical in

543
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,560
Indian musical instrument I haven't

544
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,330
tried to look like an Indian when I was

545
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,630
second years - not bad yes and the

546
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,060
actually it was strongly encouraged by

547
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,520
the by the instructors in my school

548
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,120
because this the graduates of my school

549
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,940
were later on employed as diplomats

550
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,040
foreign journalists or spies as every

551
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,390
Soviet student I

552
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,680
quote-unquote volunteering for

553
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,010
harvesting grain in Kazakhstan this is a

554
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,730
biggest agricultural blunder of the

555
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,450
Soviet government but I didn't have much

556
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,610
choice of course because the Communist

557
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,710
motto borrowed from the Bible says those

558
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,500
who do not work shall not eat and you

559
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,630
can see me eating therefore I was

560
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,700
working and you can see how happy I was

561
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,250
about it I went through a very extensive

562
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,240
physical and military training including

563
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,270
the manure and including the military

564
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,990
games in areas suburban areas of Moscow

565
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,570
and here for example we are on the tour

566
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,630
in our hankins area and by the end of my

567
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,520
training in school I was recruited by

568
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,680
the KGB this picture was taken on that

569
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,080
day and you can see again how happy it

570
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,470
feels to be recruited by the KGB our

571
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,540
conversation with Yuri Alexandrovich

572
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,030
basmanov who is a defector from the

573
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,340
Soviet Union a former propaganda agent

574
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,970
or novice D and the KGB will continue

575
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,960
after this message

576
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:16,380
[Music]

577
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,140
all right as every student in USSR I

578
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,200
went through very extensive physical and

579
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,810
military training and Civil Defence

580
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,390
training - unlike in United States

581
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,670
where civil defense is virtually

582
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:40,050
non-existent zero in USSR every student

583
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,660
whatever is major subject has to go

584
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,040
through very extensive four-year

585
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,530
military and civil defence training you

586
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,240
can see me here with a group of students

587
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,610
during one of the war games in near

588
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,650
Moscow the main idea of course is to

589
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,320
prepare a huge reserve army of the USSR

590
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,740
each student has to graduate as a junior

591
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,510
Lefton and in my case it was

592
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,330
administrative and military intelligence

593
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,750
service my first assignment was to India

594
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,430
as a translator with the Soviet

595
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,220
economical aid group building refinery

596
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,560
complexes in the heart State and which

597
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,780
are at stake at the time I was still

598
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,410
naively idealistically believing that

599
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,560
what I was doing contributes to the

600
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,520
understanding and cooperation between

601
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,910
the nations it took me quite a number of

602
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,650
years to realize that what we were

603
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,140
bringing to India was a new type of

604
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,960
colonialism thousand times more

605
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,370
oppressive and exploitative than any

606
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,020
colonialism or imperialism in history of

607
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,560
mankind but at that time I was still

608
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,570
hoping that well maybe it's not that bad

609
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,150
could be worse and things may go for

610
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,780
better and I even tried to implement the

611
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,210
beautiful Marxist motto proletarians of

612
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,090
all the countries unite I tried to unite

613
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,900
with the nice indian girl and I was

614
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,280
actually I was fascinated by Indian

615
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,890
culture by by the family life in in this

616
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,350
country but obviously Communist Party

617
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,330
had different plans for my genes so I

618
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,020
had to marry this beautiful Russian girl

619
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,090
in the span of my career I married three

620
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,720
times

621
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,060
most of these marriages were marriages

622
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,490
of convenience on advice from the

623
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,860
Department of Personnel this is normal

624
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,200
practice in USSR when the Soviet citizen

625
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,450
is assigned to a foreign job

626
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,059
he has to be married either to keep

627
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,840
family in USSR as hostages or if it's a

628
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,080
convenience marriage like mine so that

629
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,850
the husband and wife are virtually

630
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,130
informers on each other to prevent

631
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,789
defection or contamination by decadent

632
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,399
imperialist or capitalist ideas in my

633
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,039
case I hated that girl so much that the

634
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,830
moment I landed in Moscow we we were

635
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,940
divorced and I I married late a second

636
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,220
time by the end of my first assignment

637
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,830
in India I was promoted to the position

638
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,470
of a public relations officer you can

639
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,470
see me here translating a speech by a

640
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,649
Soviet boss and on the right I am on the

641
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,440
right here yes and it was the occasion

642
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
was commissioning of the refinery

643
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,889
complex in Bihar Bharani back in Moscow

644
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,080
I was immediately recruited by novice

645
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,210
tea press agency which is a propaganda

646
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,090
and ideological subversion front for the

647
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,019
KGB 75% of the members of the novice tea

648
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,720
are commissioned officers of the KGB the

649
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,600
other 25 are like myself co-opted and

650
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,480
agents who are assigned to specific

651
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,299
operations in this particular case you

652
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,130
can see me talking to students of

653
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,320
Lumumba Friendship University in Moscow

654
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,490
and this is the universe cooled under

655
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,490
the direct control of the KGB and

656
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,429
Central Committee where future leaders

657
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:03,960
of the so-called national liberation

658
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,380
movements are being educated and

659
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,990
selected carefully and some of them have

660
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,539
absolutely they ignited this for example

661
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,340
is a group of students from the moment

662
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,750
they don't look like students at all

663
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,220
they look more like military and that's

664
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,960
exactly what they were they were

665
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,029
dispatched back to their countries to be

666
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,370
leaders of the so-called national

667
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,440
liberation movements or to be translated

668
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,940
into normal human language leaders of

669
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,529
international terrorist groups another

670
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:36,659
area of activity when I was working for

671
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,940
the novice team was to accompany groups

672
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,130
of so-called progressive intellectuals

673
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,139
writers journalists publishers

674
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,570
teachers professors of colleges you can

675
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,000
see me here in Kremlin I'm second on the

676
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,220
left with a group of Pakistani and

677
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,970
Indian intellectuals most of them

678
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,880
pretend that they don't understand that

679
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,740
we are actually working on behalf of the

680
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,380
Soviet government and the KGB they

681
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,750
pretended that they are actually being

682
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,779
guests a VIP intellectuals that they are

683
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,940
treated according to their merits and

684
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,210
and their intellectual abilities for us

685
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,220
they were just a bunch of political

686
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,889
prostitutes to be taken advantage for

687
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:23,590
various propaganda operations therefore

688
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,950
you can see perfectly well they senior

689
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,139
colleague of mine on the Left doesn't

690
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:31,059
really have that much respect on his

691
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,760
face and myself with a very skeptical

692
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,919
smile typical KGB sarcastic smile

693
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,120
anticipating another victim of

694
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,690
ideological brainwashing this is how a

695
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,649
typical conference in novice tea

696
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,100
headquarters in Moscow look likes

697
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,960
sitting in the middle is boris butakov

698
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,179
the then director of norms depress

699
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:57,730
agency high-ranking party bureaucrat in

700
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,159
the Department of propaganda I am

701
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,950
standing next to a famous Indian poet

702
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,190
Sumitra London punt he was famous

703
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,010
because he was an author he was the

704
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,850
author of the famous poem titled

705
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,260
Rhapsody to Lenin that's why he was

706
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,620
invited to USSR and everything was paid

707
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,860
then by the Soviet government the pay

708
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,600
special attention to number of bottles

709
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,029
on the table this is one of the ways to

710
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:29,080
kill the awareness or curiosity of the

711
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,409
foreign journalists my one of my

712
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:34,470
functions was to keep foreign guests

713
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,090
permanently intoxicated the moment they

714
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,850
land at Moscow Airport I had to take

715
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,580
them to the VIP launch and toast to

716
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,409
friendship and understanding within the

717
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:47,049
nations of the world glass of vodka then

718
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:49,630
the second glass of vodka and in no time

719
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,610
my guests would be feeling very happy

720
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,409
they would see everything in kind of

721
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:58,220
pink nice color and that's the way I

722
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,559
I had to keep them permanently for the

723
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,150
next 15 or 20 days at certain point in

724
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,400
time I had to withdraw alcohol from them

725
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,560
so that some of them were the most

726
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,119
recruitable would feel a little bit

727
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,609
shaky guilty trying to remember what

728
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,770
they were talking last night that's the

729
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,750
time to approach them with all kind of

730
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,300
nonsense such as joint communique or

731
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,690
statement for Soviet propaganda that's

732
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,580
the time they aren't the most flexible

733
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,770
and of course what they didn't

734
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,869
understand they didn't realize who

735
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,389
pretended not to realize that myself who

736
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,460
was drinking together with them

737
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,800
was not drinking at all I had ways to

738
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,050
get rid of alcohol through various

739
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,929
techniques including special pills which

740
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,629
were given to me by my colleagues but

741
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:46,250
they were taking it seriously in other

742
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,050
words they they they would consume quite

743
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,500
large volumes of alcohol and feel quite

744
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,170
uneasy next morning in 1967 the KGB

745
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,109
attached me to this magazine Look

746
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,170
magazine a group of 12 people arrived to

747
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,230
USSR from United States to cover the

748
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,839
50th anniversary of October socialist

749
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,390
revolution in my country from the first

750
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,369
page to the last page it was a package

751
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:16,460
of lies propaganda cliche which were

752
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,780
presented to American readers as

753
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,940
opinions and deductions of American

754
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,820
journalists nothing could be far from

755
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,270
truth this were not opinions they were

756
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,240
not opinions at all they were the

757
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,310
cliches which the Soviet propaganda

758
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,400
wants American public to think that they

759
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,020
think if it does make any sense at all

760
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,570
it sure does because from the viewpoint

761
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,400
of the Soviet propaganda although there

762
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,380
are some subtle criticism of the Soviet

763
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,109
system the basic message is that Russia

764
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,830
today is a nice functioning efficient

765
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,839
system supported by majority of

766
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,030
population that's the biggest lie

767
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,490
and of course American intellectuals and

768
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,950
journalists from Luke magazine

769
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,540
elaborated on that untruth in various

770
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,349
different ways

771
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:10,490
they intellectualize that lie they found

772
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,440
all kind of justification

773
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,360
for telling lies to American public this

774
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,880
is assuming it was partly your job to

775
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,010
make sure that they got these ideas yes

776
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,320
accepted them as their own idea right

777
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,380
actually even before they arrive to USSR

778
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,510
and they paid astronomical sum of money

779
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,200
for that visit they were submitted that

780
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,210
this novice oppressed agency developed

781
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,720
so-called backgrounders 20 25 pages of

782
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,880
information and opinions which were

783
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,100
presented to the journalists even before

784
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,710
they bought their tickets to Moscow they

785
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,870
had to analyze the situation and judging

786
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,270
on their reaction to that background the

787
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,820
local novice the representative or local

788
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,580
Soviet diplomat in Washington DC would

789
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,800
assess whether they have whether they'd

790
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,700
be given visa to USSR or not so they

791
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,440
were selected oh yes they were they were

792
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,110
pre-selected very carefully and there is

793
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,090
not much chance for honest journalists

794
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,030
to arrive to USSR and to stay there for

795
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,820
one year and to bring this package of

796
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,460
lies back home this for example is a

797
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,380
centerfold of the tide of the Look

798
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,230
magazine they presented this monument

799
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,180
erected by Communist Party in Stalingrad

800
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,660
as the symbol personification of Russian

801
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,810
military might and they said in the

802
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,970
article which is published on on the

803
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,580
side that Soviets are very proud of the

804
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,950
victory in the Second World War this is

805
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,220
another big myth a lie no sensible

806
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,260
people would be proud to lose 20

807
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,270
millions of their countrymen in the war

808
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,910
which was started by Ginoza Hitler and

809
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,430
Comrade Stalin and paid by American

810
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,590
multinationals most of the Soviet

811
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,600
citizens look at this type of monuments

812
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,360
with disgust and sorrow because every

813
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,790
family lost father brother sister or

814
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,930
child in the Second World War yet

815
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,720
American journalists who were trying to

816
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,470
appease to please their hosts presented

817
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,990
this picture on the centerfold as the

818
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,270
symbol and personification of Soviet

819
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,210
national they call it Russian national

820
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,340
spirit and it was greatest greatest

821
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,080
misconception and in a very tragic miss

822
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,359
and

823
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,880
standing of course Luke magazine was not

824
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,569
distributed in USSR the main audience

825
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:35,680
was in the United States but I presume

826
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,930
that many Americans millions of

827
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,640
Americans who were reading Look magazine

828
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,960
at that time had absolutely wrong idea

829
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,559
about the sentiments of my nation about

830
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,839
what the Soviets are proud of and what

831
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,989
they hate this is a group you see the

832
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:55,509
same lady with this ward in Stalingrad

833
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:57,579
this is the group of journalists myself

834
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,410
is in the center with the same devilish

835
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,079
smile and mr. Philip Harrington is on

836
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,039
the extreme left there with his camera

837
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,119
this is the gentleman which was so deaf

838
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,359
were so uninterested in what I had to

839
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,589
say to him this is the same picture a

840
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,609
blow-up of the same of the same picture

841
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:24,640
many many guests from various countries

842
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,559
in this particular case from Asia and

843
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,920
Africa were taken by me as a novice to

844
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,220
press agency employee for a tour across

845
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,589
Siberia for example we would show them

846
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:38,019
typical kindergarten you see nothing

847
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:40,809
special by American standards just nice

848
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:42,970
children sitting eating their breakfast

849
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,680
or lunch what they could not understand

850
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,170
or they pretended not to understand that

851
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,839
this is an exemplary kindergarten this

852
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,579
is not the kindergarten for average

853
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:58,089
person or every family in USSR and we

854
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:00,609
maintained that illusion in their minds

855
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,549
you can see myself under the red spot in

856
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:05,589
the middle there with the same

857
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:08,799
businesslike expression iemon you know

858
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,539
I'm doing my job that that's what I am

859
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,130
assigned to do and that's what I was

860
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,039
paid to do but deep inside I still hope

861
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,200
that at least some of these useful

862
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,630
idiots would understand that what they

863
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,339
are looking at has nothing to do with

864
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:24,880
the level of affluence in my nation this

865
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,880
is a better picture which reflects the

866
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,980
true spirit of of the Soviet Soviet

867
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,259
childhood this picture was printed in a

868
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,599
Canadian government publication by

869
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,560
mistake

870
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,600
in the middle you can see children

871
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,270
playing on a small courtyard and the

872
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,320
caption goes

873
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,270
this is a typical kindergarten in

874
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,880
Siberia what this idiots didn't

875
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,160
understand that it is not kindergarten

876
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,970
at all

877
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,450
it is a prison for children of political

878
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,450
prisoners but there was not a single

879
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,400
mentioning that what they were visiting

880
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,590
actually was an area of concentration

881
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,950
camps and the job of people like myself

882
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,580
to help them to me not to notice that

883
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,460
they are actually talking to prisoners

884
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,600
most of the children were dressed

885
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,070
especially on the occasion of the

886
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,460
foreigners visit the of course there

887
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,920
were no corpses and on the ground there

888
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,430
were no machine-gun guards and the well

889
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,740
it looks not very pleasant as you see it

890
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,170
so it looks dull but obviously it does

891
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,960
not create an impression that this is

892
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,850
actually a prison well did any of the

893
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,670
journalists have the curiosity to ask

894
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,130
about prisons and that kind of in

895
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,470
Siberia yes is what you saw yes some of

896
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,240
them ask questions and naturally we

897
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,400
would give them for the stupid question

898
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,260
we give them stupid answer no there are

899
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,600
no prisons in Siberia no most of the

900
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,730
people who will you see our free

901
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,980
citizens of USSR they are very happy to

902
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,160
be here and they are contributing to the

903
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,700
glory of the socialist system some of

904
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,310
them pretended that they believed what

905
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:08,050
what I was telling them and most of them

906
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,060
we may discuss it later what are the

907
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,460
motivations of these people why would

908
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,380
they stubbornly bring lies to their own

909
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,780
population through their own mass media

910
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,360
I have various answers to this there is

911
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,700
not a single explanation it's a complex

912
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,790
of explanations it's fear pure

913
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,830
biological fear they understand that

914
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,720
they are on the territory of an enemy

915
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,540
state a police state and just to save

916
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,940
their rotten skins and their miserable

917
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,430
jobs their affluence back home they

918
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,010
would prefer to tell a lie than to ask

919
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,500
truthful questions and report truthful

920
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,590
information second most of these

921
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,590
Schmucks were afraid to lose their jobs

922
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,630
because obviously if you tell truth

923
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,670
about my country you will not last long

924
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,239
as

925
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,969
correspondent of New York Times or Los

926
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,039
Angeles Times they will fire you

927
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:59,019
what kind of correspondent are you you

928
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,459
obviously cannot find common language

929
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:03,339
with Russians if they kick you out in 24

930
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:07,119
hours so just by by trying to be confirm

931
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,969
this to their own editorial bosses they

932
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:12,369
tried not to offend the sentiments of

933
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:14,289
the Soviet administrators and people

934
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,749
like myself deep inside I hope they

935
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:20,619
would insult my or offend by sentiments

936
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:24,549
obviously they preferred not to another

937
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:28,089
reason I did I refuse to believe it but

938
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:29,499
obviously there is another reason

939
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:33,369
obviously it's agreed these people earn

940
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:35,319
a lot of money when they come back to

941
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:38,409
USA they claim that they are experts in

942
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:40,809
my country they write books which sells

943
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:43,899
a million copies title like Russians the

944
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:44,979
truth about Russia

945
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:48,039
most of it is lie about Russia yet they

946
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,579
claim to be Soviet ologists they they

947
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:53,739
break they play back myth about my

948
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:57,129
country the propaganda cliches yet they

949
00:43:57,129 --> 00:44:00,009
stubbornly resisted the word of truth if

950
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:03,489
a person like Solzhenitsyn is either

951
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:05,769
defecting or kicked out of USSR

952
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,439
they try all their best to this to

953
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:10,649
discredit him and to discourage him I

954
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,089
don't have much chance to appear on

955
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:15,579
national network with the true story

956
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:18,189
about my country but the useful eejit

957
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:21,009
like Hendrik Smith or Robert Kaiser they

958
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:23,379
are big heroes they come back from USSR

959
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:25,029
they say all we were talking to

960
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,759
dissidents in Russia big deal

961
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:30,399
so the distance a chasing American

962
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:32,649
correspondents in the streets and they

963
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:35,099
are cowardly escaping from this context

964
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,599
for some strange reason if you want to

965
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,459
know more about Spain you refer to

966
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:41,829
Spanish writers if you want to learn

967
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:44,679
more about French you read French or

968
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,099
writers even about Antarctica I bet you

969
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,379
would rip in Queens only about the

970
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:52,479
Soviet Union for some strange reason you

971
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:54,609
read Hendrix and Schmendrick sand all

972
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,249
kind of Kissinger's because they claim

973
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:59,469
that they know more about my country

974
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,899
they know nothing or next to nothing

975
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,970
oh they pretend that they know more

976
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,180
than they actually do I would say they

977
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,880
are dishonest people who lack integrity

978
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,360
and common sense and intellectual

979
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,910
honesty they bring back all kind of

980
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,430
stories like that a kindergarten in

981
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,400
Siberia a meeting the most important

982
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,140
fact it's a prison

983
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,630
for children of political prisoners

984
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,180
another greatest example of monumental

985
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,230
idiocy of American politicians Edward

986
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:38,440
Kennedy was in Moscow and he thought

987
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,020
that he is a popular charismatic

988
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,590
American politician who is easygoing who

989
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,930
can smile dance at the wedding in in

990
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,900
Russian palace of marriages what he done

991
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,000
what he did not understand or maybe he

992
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,590
pretended not to understand that

993
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,950
actually he was being taken for a ride

994
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,930
this is a staged wedding especially to

995
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,110
impress foreign media or or useful

996
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,760
idiots like Ed Kennedy

997
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,750
most of the of the guests there they had

998
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,700
security clearance and they were

999
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,210
instructed what to say to foreigners

1000
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,860
this is exactly what I was doing you can

1001
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,920
see me in the same damn wedding palace

1002
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,560
in Moscow where F Kennedy was dancing

1003
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,440
here is he smiling he thinks he is very

1004
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,600
smart from the viewpoint of Russian

1005
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,320
citizens who observed this idiocy he is

1006
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,560
his narrow-minded ego centrical idiot

1007
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,170
who tries to earn his own popularity

1008
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,420
through the through participation in

1009
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,700
propaganda Fox is like this here you can

1010
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,030
see myself on the right again exemplary

1011
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,630
Soviet bride on the left three

1012
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,100
journalists from various countries Asia

1013
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,240
Africa and Latin America obviously they

1014
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,070
enjoying the situation they they will go

1015
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,320
back home and write the reports we were

1016
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,720
present in the on the regular Soviet

1017
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,910
wedding they were not present on a

1018
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,950
regular Soviet reading they were present

1019
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,620
they were part of a farce of a circus

1020
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:11,410
performance another thing which I had to

1021
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,870
sometimes risking my life to explain to

1022
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:17,030
foreigners Prime magazine for example is

1023
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,300
very critical of South African racist

1024
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,290
regime the whole article was dedicated

1025
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,900
to the shameful internal passport system

1026
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,900
where black blacks are not allowing to

1027
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,630
live with whites for some strange reason

1028
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,460
for the last fourteen years since my

1029
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,230
defection nobody wanted to pay attention

1030
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,200
to my passport this is my passport

1031
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,740
it also shows my nationality and it has

1032
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,780
a police rubber stamp which is called

1033
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,270
prat Pisgah in Russian language which

1034
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,760
assigns me to a certain area of

1035
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,970
residence I cannot leave that area same

1036
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,980
way as this black man cannot leave the

1037
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,370
area in South Africa yet we call South

1038
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,460
African government racist regime not a

1039
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,820
single Jane Jane Fonda or Fonda is brave

1040
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,710
enough courageous enough to come to

1041
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,080
mediate and say look this is what

1042
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,480
happens in u.s. a song I send a copy of

1043
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,270
my passport to many American liberals

1044
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,690
and civil rights defenders and all the

1045
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,520
other useful idiots they never they

1046
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,130
never bothered to answer me back this

1047
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,110
shows what kind of integrity what kind

1048
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,720
of honesty these people are they are a

1049
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,670
bunch of hypocrites because they don't

1050
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,430
want to recognize a good example of

1051
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:36,170
races in my country this is the first

1052
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,330
stage of befriending a professor you can

1053
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,070
see myself on the left with the same

1054
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,130
James Bond smile on my on the right is

1055
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,710
my KGB supervisor comrade Leonid metro

1056
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,750
Keon and in the middle a professor of

1057
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,570
political science in Delhi University

1058
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,430
the next stage would be to invite him to

1059
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,590
a gathering of in the Soviet Friendship

1060
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,630
Society there he is sitting next to his

1061
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,290
wife before he is being sent to USSR for

1062
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,300
free trip everything is paid by the

1063
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,880
Soviet government he was made to believe

1064
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,430
that he is invited to USSR because he is

1065
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,590
a talented sober thinking intellectual

1066
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,090
absolutely false he is invited because

1067
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,010
he is a useful idiot because he would

1068
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,560
agree and subscribe to most of the

1069
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,230
Soviet propaganda cliche and when he is

1070
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,420
coming back to his own country he is

1071
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,120
going for years and years to teach the

1072
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,420
beauties of Soviet socialism to newer

1073
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,980
and newer generations

1074
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,560
students thus promoting the Soviet

1075
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,720
propaganda line the KGB was even curious

1076
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,030
about this gentleman it may look

1077
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,090
innocent Maharishi Mahesh Yogi a great

1078
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,550
spiritual leader or maybe a great

1079
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,310
charlatan and crook depending on which

1080
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,460
from which side you are looking at him

1081
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,500
beetles were trained at his ashram in

1082
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,020
hardware in India how to meditate mia

1083
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,320
farrow and other useful idiots from

1084
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,160
Hollywood visited his school and they

1085
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,900
returned back to the United States

1086
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,790
absolutely stoned out of their minds

1087
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,520
with marijuana hashish and crazy ideas

1088
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,430
of meditation to meditate in other words

1089
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,119
to isolate oneself from the current

1090
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,650
social and political issues of your own

1091
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,859
country to get into your own bubble to

1092
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:23,410
forget about troubles of the world

1093
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,630
obviously KGB was very fascinated with

1094
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,930
such a beautiful school such a

1095
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,910
brainwashing center for stupid Americans

1096
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,280
I was dispatched by the KGB to check

1097
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,160
what kind of VIP Americans attend this

1098
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,050
school that's you analyzed yes I am on

1099
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,770
the left I was trying to get enrolled in

1100
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,660
that school unfortunately the Maharishi

1101
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,510
Mahesh Yogi asked too much he wanted 500

1102
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,359
American dollars for enrollment but my

1103
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:51,980
function was not actually to get

1104
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,690
enrolled in the school my function was

1105
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,940
to discover what kind of people from

1106
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,170
United States attend this school and we

1107
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,660
discovered that yes there are some

1108
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,710
influential members of family public

1109
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,369
opinion makers of United States who come

1110
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:12,619
back with the crazy stories about Indian

1111
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:15,800
philosophy Indians themselves look up

1112
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,430
upon them as idiots useful idiots to say

1113
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:21,470
nothing about KGB who looked at them as

1114
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:26,500
as as extremely naive misguided people

1115
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,380
obviously a VIP say a wife of a

1116
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,430
congressman or or a prominent Hollywood

1117
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,990
personality after the after being

1118
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,420
trained in that school is much more

1119
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,160
instrumental in the hands of

1120
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,490
manipulators of public opinion

1121
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:45,670
KGB then a normal person who who

1122
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,710
understands who looks through this is

1123
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,450
sure this this type of fake religious

1124
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,100
training now why would they be more

1125
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,080
susceptible to manipulation I just

1126
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,300
mentioned that because you see a person

1127
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,610
who is too much involved in in

1128
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,410
introspective meditation you see if you

1129
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,090
carefully look what what Maharishi

1130
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,520
Mahesh Yogi is teaching to to Americans

1131
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,880
is that all most of the problems most of

1132
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,160
the burning issues of today can be

1133
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,520
solved simply by meditating don't don't

1134
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,430
don't rock the boat don't get involved

1135
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,470
just sit down look at your navel and

1136
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,750
meditate and the things due to some

1137
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,480
strange logic due to cosmic vibration

1138
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,170
will settle down by themselves this is

1139
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,330
exactly what the KGB and Marxist

1140
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,430
Leninist propaganda ones from Americans

1141
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:40,210
to distract their opinion attention and

1142
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,390
mental energy from real issues of United

1143
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,119
States into an on issues into a known

1144
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:50,170
world non existent harmony obviously

1145
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,640
it's more beneficial for the Soviet

1146
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,100
aggressors to have a bunch of duped

1147
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,960
Americans than Americans who are

1148
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,380
self-conscious healthy physically fit

1149
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,310
and alert to the reality Maharishi

1150
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,020
Mahesh Yogi obviously is not on the

1151
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,770
payroll of the KGB but whether he knows

1152
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,680
it or not he contributes greatly to

1153
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,150
generalization of American society and

1154
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,460
he is not the only one there are

1155
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,859
hundreds of those gurus who come to you

1156
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:20,560
to your country to capitalize on naivete

1157
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,740
and stupidity of Americans it's a

1158
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,140
fashion it's a fashion to meditate it's

1159
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,680
a fashion not to be involved so

1160
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,210
obviously you can see that if KGB were

1161
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,740
that curious if they paid my trip to

1162
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,380
Harvard if they assigned me to that to

1163
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,869
that strange job obviously they were

1164
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,810
very much fascinated they were convinced

1165
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,359
that that type of brainwashing is very

1166
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,050
efficient and instrumental in the more

1167
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,660
the United States our conversation with

1168
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,510
Yuri Alexandrovich Esme INAF who is a

1169
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,520
defector from the Soviet Union a form of

1170
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,850
propaganda agent for novice D and KGB

1171
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,280
will continue after this message

1172
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:19,409
[Music]

1173
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,390
[Music]

1174
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,980
this picture shows the part of the

1175
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,020
building of USSR embassy and my

1176
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,960
supervisors on the left is comrade McGee

1177
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,119
an Indian communist and on the right

1178
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:37,119
comrade Metro him my supervisors in the

1179
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,830
secret Department of research and

1180
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:41,590
counter-propaganda it has nothing to do

1181
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,910
with either research or country

1182
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,910
propaganda most of the activity of the

1183
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,940
department was to compile huge ammount

1184
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,420
volume of information on individuals who

1185
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,460
were instrumental in creating public

1186
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,470
opinion publishers editors journalists

1187
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:02,260
actors educationalists professors of

1188
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,790
political science members of parliament

1189
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,190
representatives of business circles most

1190
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,869
of these people were divided roughly

1191
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:13,090
into groups those who would toe the

1192
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,830
Soviet foreign policy they would be

1193
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,540
promoted to the positions of power

1194
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,550
through media and public opinion

1195
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,800
manipulation those who refused the

1196
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,540
Soviet influence in their own country

1197
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,920
would be character assassinated or

1198
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,920
executed physically come revolution same

1199
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,980
way as in a small town of Heuer in south

1200
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,050
vietnam several thousands of Vietnamese

1201
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:38,170
were executed in one night when the city

1202
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,300
was captured by the Vietcong for only

1203
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,210
two days an American CIA could never

1204
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,520
figure out how could possibly communists

1205
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,830
know each individual where he lives

1206
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,290
where where to get him and would be

1207
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,060
arrested in one night

1208
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,580
basically in some four hours before dawn

1209
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,460
put on a van taken out of the city

1210
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,890
limits and shot the answer is very

1211
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,550
simple

1212
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,440
long before communists occupied the city

1213
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,820
there was extensive network of informers

1214
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,619
local Vietnamese citizens who knew

1215
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:11,050
absolutely everything about people who

1216
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,400
are instrumental in public opinion

1217
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,210
including barbers and taxi drivers

1218
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,170
everyone who is sympathetic to the

1219
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,780
United States was executed same thing

1220
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,300
was done under the guidance of the

1221
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,490
Soviet embassy in Hanoi and same thing I

1222
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,920
was doing in New Delhi to my horror I

1223
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,630
discovered that in the files where

1224
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,300
people were doomed to execution there

1225
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,330
were names of pro-soviet journalists

1226
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,100
with whom I was personally

1227
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,770
friendly pressure of you yes they were

1228
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,100
idealistically minded leftists who made

1229
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,520
several visits to USSR and yet the KGB

1230
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,860
decided that come revolution or drastic

1231
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,350
changes in political structure of India

1232
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,320
they will have to go wise not because

1233
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,290
they know too much

1234
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,880
simply because you see the useful idiots

1235
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,400
the the leftists who are idealistic aliy

1236
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,320
believing in the beauty of soviet

1237
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,910
socialist or communist or whatever

1238
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:07,090
system when they get disillusioned they

1239
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,220
become the worst enemies that's why my

1240
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,590
KGB instructors specifically made a

1241
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,980
point never bother with leftists forget

1242
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,080
about these political prostitutes aim

1243
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,470
higher this was my instruction try to

1244
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,920
get into into large circulation

1245
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,220
established conservative media reach

1246
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,460
filthy rich movie makers intellectuals

1247
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,040
so-called academic circles cynical

1248
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,170
egocentric people who can look into your

1249
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,210
eyes with angelic expression and tell

1250
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,970
you a lie this are the most recruitable

1251
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,160
people people who lack moral principles

1252
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,150
who are either too greedy or to suffer

1253
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,400
from self-importance

1254
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,270
they feel that they they matter a lot

1255
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,460
these are the people who KGB wanted very

1256
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,340
much to recruit but to eliminate the

1257
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,230
others to execute the others don't they

1258
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,880
serve some purpose wouldn't they be not

1259
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,860
one they realize they serve purpose only

1260
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,960
at the stage of destabilization of a

1261
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,410
nation for example your leftists in

1262
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,150
United States all these professors and

1263
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,040
all this beautiful civil rights

1264
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,980
defenders they are instrumental in the

1265
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,790
process of the of the subversion only to

1266
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,090
destabilize the nation when their job is

1267
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,130
completed they are known they are not

1268
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:24,970
needed anymore

1269
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:28,150
they know too much some of them when

1270
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,740
they get disillusioned when they see

1271
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,450
that Marxist Leninist come to power

1272
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,240
obviously they get offended they think

1273
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,250
that they will come to power that will

1274
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,750
never happen of course they will be

1275
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,120
lined up against the wall and shot but

1276
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,220
they may turn into the most bitter

1277
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,860
enemies of Marxist Leninist when they

1278
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,540
come to power and that's what happened

1279
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,490
in Nicaragua you remember most of this

1280
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,960
former Marx

1281
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,180
Leninist word either put to prison or

1282
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,369
one of them split and now he is working

1283
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:57,910
again Sandinistas it happened in Granada

1284
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,580
when Maurice Bishop was he was already a

1285
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,490
Marxist he was executed by a new Marxist

1286
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,320
who was more Marxist than this Marxist

1287
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,170
same happen in Afghanistan when first

1288
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,000
there was Taraki he was killed by I mean

1289
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,440
then I mean was killed by babrak karmal

1290
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,290
with the help of KGB same happen in him

1291
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:16,480
in Bangladesh when Mujibur Rahman very

1292
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,540
Pro Soviet leftist was assassinated by

1293
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,609
his own Marxist Leninist

1294
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:24,250
military comrades it's the same pattern

1295
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,859
everywhere the moment they serve their

1296
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:29,050
purpose all the useful idiots are used

1297
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:32,080
either be executed entirely all the

1298
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,810
idealistic reminded Marxist or were

1299
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:37,480
exiled or put in prisons like in Cuba

1300
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,609
many many former Marxists are in Cuba I

1301
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:43,150
mean in prison so most of the Indians

1302
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,980
who were cooperating with the Soviets

1303
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,839
especially without the Department of

1304
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:51,700
Information of the USSR embassy were

1305
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,540
listed for execution and when I

1306
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,790
discovered that fact of course I was

1307
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,190
sick I was mentally and physically sick

1308
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,930
I thought the time I'm going to explode

1309
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,089
one day during the briefing at the

1310
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:05,859
ambassador's office I would stand up and

1311
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:07,780
say something that we are basically a

1312
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,180
bunch of murderers that's what we are we

1313
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,130
there's nothing to do with friendship

1314
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:14,170
and understanding between the nation and

1315
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,930
bla bla bla we're murderers we behave as

1316
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:19,330
a bunch of thugs in the country which

1317
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,609
which is hospitable to us a country

1318
01:00:21,609 --> 01:00:24,910
which which with ancient traditions but

1319
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,369
I I did not the fact I tried to get the

1320
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:29,080
message across to my horror

1321
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,660
nobody wanted even to listen least of

1322
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,570
all to believe what I had to say and I

1323
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,430
tried all kinds of tricks I would I

1324
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,830
would I would leak information through

1325
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:42,460
letters or lost documents or something

1326
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,830
like that and still I got no message the

1327
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,869
message was not published even in the

1328
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:50,260
conservative mass media of India the

1329
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,970
immediate impulse to defect was

1330
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,070
Bangladesh crisis which was described by

1331
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:57,130
American correspondents as Islamic

1332
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,830
grassroot revolution

1333
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,800
which is absolute baloney there was

1334
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,690
nothing to do with Islam and there was

1335
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,520
no grassroot revolution actually there

1336
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,770
are no grassroot revolutions period any

1337
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,870
revolution is a byproduct of a highly

1338
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,080
organized group of conscientious and

1339
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,410
professional organizers but there's

1340
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,420
nothing to do with grassroot in

1341
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,970
Bangladesh it was nothing with

1342
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,550
grassroots most of the Avani League

1343
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,010
party members of a mulignans People's

1344
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,190
Party were trained in Moscow in the high

1345
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,770
party school most of the Mukti Fauj

1346
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:34,140
leaders Mukti forages in Benghazi means

1347
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,020
People's Army same as SWAPO and and all

1348
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,970
kind of Liberation Army's all over the

1349
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,430
world the same bunch of useful idiots

1350
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,110
they were trained at Lumumba University

1351
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,110
and various centres of the KGB in

1352
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:49,580
Simferopol in in Crimea and in Tashkent

1353
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,130
so when I saw that India Indian

1354
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,470
territory is being used as a jumping

1355
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,450
board to destroy East Pakistan

1356
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:00,510
I saw myself thousands of so-called

1357
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:04,050
students traveling through India to East

1358
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,030
Pakistan through the territory of India

1359
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,670
and Indian government pretended not to

1360
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,620
see what was going on they knew

1361
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,210
perfectly well the Indian pollutin knew

1362
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,430
it the intelligence Department of Indian

1363
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,590
government knew it the KGB of course

1364
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:19,260
knew it and the CIA knew it that that

1365
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,150
was most infuriating because when I

1366
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,010
defected and I explained to the CIA

1367
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,410
debriefers they should watch out because

1368
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,270
East Pakistan is going to erupt any

1369
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,760
moment they said that I was look I was

1370
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,300
reading to too many James Bond novels

1371
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,290
anyway so East Pakistan was doomed one

1372
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,180
of my colleagues in in the Soviet

1373
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,040
consulate in Calcutta when he was dead

1374
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,140
drunk he ventured into the basement to

1375
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,750
relieve himself and he found the big

1376
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,720
boxes which said printed matter to Dhaka

1377
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,660
University Dhaka is the capital of East

1378
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,360
Pakistan and since he was drunk and

1379
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,370
curious he opened one of the boxes and

1380
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,440
he discovered not printed metric he

1381
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,060
discovered Kalashnikov guns and

1382
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,340
ammunition in there anyway it's a long

1383
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,860
story when I saw the preparations for

1384
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,470
the for the invasion into East Pakistan

1385
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:10,350
obviously I wanted to defect immediate

1386
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,930
the only thing I couldn't I couldn't at

1387
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,660
that time and make up my mind when and

1388
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,450
where and how one of the reasons of

1389
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,760
course you see I was in love with the

1390
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,310
India I mentioned it before I spoke the

1391
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,340
languages I socialized with people and I

1392
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:29,910
understood that I had to act fast unless

1393
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:32,060
I want this beautiful country to be

1394
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,920
permanently and irreparably damaged by

1395
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,850
our presence one of the reasons not to

1396
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,890
defect was as you can see I was living

1397
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,590
in relative affluence who the hell in

1398
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,220
the normal mind would defect and do what

1399
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,890
to be abused by your media to be called

1400
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:53,250
McCarthy stand fascist and paranoid or

1401
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,860
to drive attacks in New York City what

1402
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,690
for what they have for should I defect

1403
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,260
to be abused by Americans to be insulted

1404
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,780
in exchange for my effort to bring the

1405
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,550
truthful information about impending

1406
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,610
danger subversion as you can see I was

1407
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,410
living in quite the comfortable

1408
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,330
conditions next to swimming pool where

1409
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,160
Indians were not allowed by the way I

1410
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,920
was highly paid expert in propaganda I

1411
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,109
had my family I was respected by my

1412
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:23,100
nation my career was cloudless the third

1413
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,910
reason how to defect with the family to

1414
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,350
the fact that the baby and the wife

1415
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:30,690
would be virtual suicide because

1416
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:33,480
according to law that hypocritical law

1417
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,940
which I quoted before the Indian police

1418
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,440
will have to hand me over back to the

1419
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,420
KGB and that will be the end of my

1420
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:43,100
defection and probably my life again i

1421
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,080
cannot smuggle my wife because she was

1422
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,050
not quite sure what what i was doing she

1423
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,119
was not that idealistically involved and

1424
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,660
she was definitely not in in the total

1425
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,240
picture what I was doing for the KGB she

1426
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,810
would be shocked if I if I you know put

1427
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,210
her in my van and drive her to your

1428
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:05,910
American Embassy or elsewhere that would

1429
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:09,660
be a greatest danger so again I had to

1430
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,400
defect in such a way that my defection

1431
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,740
would look as simple disappearance and

1432
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,050
there were many cases like that when the

1433
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,330
Soviet agent simply disappeared either

1434
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:21,740
killed in action or thanks to their

1435
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,400
curiosity and there

1436
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,559
close contacts with radical some of them

1437
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,359
were killed by the Marxists by the way

1438
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,640
it happened in many African countries

1439
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,890
when the Soviet KGB were killed by

1440
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,230
Africans themselves not because they

1441
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,210
hated Marxist Leninist but because they

1442
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,490
were simply trigger-happy bunch of

1443
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,049
unruly characters if you give them

1444
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:43,020
machine gun they will shoot and some of

1445
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,549
the Soviets obviously were not careful

1446
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:46,920
enough to protect themselves and they

1447
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,750
got into embarrassing situations when

1448
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,089
they were shot at the crossfire between

1449
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:53,430
factions of so-called liberation

1450
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,119
movements anyway so I I decided as I

1451
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,730
said to study the counterculture I

1452
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,710
decided this probably would be the best

1453
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,069
way to disappear I socialized the

1454
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:07,200
characters like this on the left you see

1455
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,970
is a barefoot American hippie it took me

1456
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,609
quite a long time to study exactly what

1457
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,650
they were doing and how to mix with them

1458
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:19,289
but eventually I did most of Indian

1459
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:21,059
newspapers carried my picture and

1460
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:23,819
promise of 2,000 rupees for information

1461
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:26,760
about my whereabouts but they were

1462
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,349
looking for wrong person because they

1463
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:31,500
obviously tried to stop a young Soviet

1464
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,130
diplomat in white shirt and tie and this

1465
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,079
is how I looked at the time of defection

1466
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,599
nobody could possibly think that the

1467
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,549
Soviet diplomat would be as crazy as to

1468
01:06:41,549 --> 01:06:43,890
join a bunch of hippies that's you right

1469
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:46,799
yes Travel Indian small cars so I made

1470
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,490
it literally is almost like a Hollywood

1471
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:55,440
style detective story from under the

1472
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,049
nose of the KGB in Bombay Airport I

1473
01:06:58,049 --> 01:07:00,900
landed the plane and I flew to Greece

1474
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,599
where I was debriefed by the CIA that's

1475
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,539
basically most that's all for my day we

1476
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,579
can slice we can turn off the projectors

1477
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,039
and that's very interesting

1478
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:12,750
well you spoke several times before

1479
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,119
about ideological subversion that is a

1480
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,760
phrase that I'm afraid some Americans

1481
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,000
don't fully understand when the Soviets

1482
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,190
used the phrase ideological subversion

1483
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,380
what do they mean by ideological

1484
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,400
subversion is is the process which is

1485
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,140
legitimate overt and open you can see it

1486
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,760
with your own eyes all you have to do

1487
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,470
American mass media has to do is to

1488
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:41,200
unplug their bananas from the ears open

1489
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,450
up their eyes and they can see it there

1490
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,280
is no mystery there is nothing to do

1491
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,740
with espionage I know that espionage

1492
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,240
intelligence-gathering looks more

1493
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,700
romantic it sells more deodorants

1494
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,710
through their advertising probably

1495
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,990
that's why your Hollywood producers are

1496
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:59,440
so crazy about James Bond type of three

1497
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,740
words but in reality the main emphasis

1498
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,590
of the KGB is not in the area of it

1499
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:08,670
intelligence at all according to my

1500
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:11,260
opinion and opinion of many defectors of

1501
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,920
my caliber only about 15% of time money

1502
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,310
and manpower is spent on espionage as

1503
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,689
such the other 85% is a slow process

1504
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:24,819
which we call either ideological

1505
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:28,000
subversion or active measures actively

1506
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,779
Mariotti in the language of the KGB or

1507
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,160
psychological warfare what it basically

1508
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,770
means is to change the perception of

1509
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:40,299
reality of every American to such an

1510
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:42,640
extent that despite of the abundance of

1511
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,120
information no one is able to come to

1512
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,029
sensible conclusions in the interests of

1513
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:51,549
defending themselves their families

1514
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:54,759
their community and their country it's a

1515
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:58,390
great brainwashing process which goes

1516
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:01,299
very slow and it's divided in four basic

1517
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:04,870
stages the first one being

1518
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,630
demoralisation it takes from 15 to 20

1519
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:10,060
years to demoralize a nation why that

1520
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,790
many years because this is the minimum

1521
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,939
number of years which requires to

1522
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,850
educate one generation of students in

1523
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:22,509
the country of your enemy exposed to the

1524
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:25,390
ideology of the enemy in other words

1525
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:28,000
Marxism Leninism ideology is being

1526
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,339
pumped into the soft heads of at least

1527
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:32,319
three generations of American students

1528
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,880
without being challenged or

1529
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,299
counterbalanced by the basic values of

1530
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:39,279
Americanism American patriotism the

1531
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,189
result the result you can see most of

1532
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:44,979
the people who graduated in sixties drop

1533
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:47,710
outs or half-baked intellectuals are now

1534
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,899
occupying the positions of power in the

1535
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:50,259
govern

1536
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:52,658
civil service business mass media

1537
01:09:52,658 --> 01:09:55,300
educational system you are stuck with

1538
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,579
them you cannot get rid of them they are

1539
01:09:57,579 --> 01:09:59,800
contaminated they are programmed to

1540
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,349
think and react to certain stimuli in a

1541
01:10:02,349 --> 01:10:04,929
certain pattern you cannot change their

1542
01:10:04,929 --> 01:10:07,539
mind even if you expose them to

1543
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:10,269
authentic information even if you prove

1544
01:10:10,269 --> 01:10:12,699
that white is white and black is black

1545
01:10:12,699 --> 01:10:14,969
you still cannot change the basic

1546
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:18,489
perception and the logic of behavior in

1547
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:22,179
other words these people the process of

1548
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:23,860
demoralization is complete and

1549
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:26,739
irreversible to get rid society of these

1550
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:29,590
people you have you need another 20 or

1551
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,429
15 years to educate a new generation of

1552
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,730
patriotically minded and and and common

1553
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:40,420
common sense people who would be acting

1554
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:44,550
in favor and in the interests of the

1555
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:47,260
United States society and yet these

1556
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,090
people have been programmed and as you

1557
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,550
say in place when you are favourable to

1558
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,550
an opening with the Soviet concept these

1559
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,139
are the very people who would be marked

1560
01:10:56,139 --> 01:10:58,000
for extermination in this case most of

1561
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,909
them yes simply because the

1562
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:03,699
psychological shock when when they will

1563
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:05,860
see in future what they what the

1564
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,139
beautiful Society of equality and social

1565
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,320
justice means in practice obviously they

1566
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,739
will revolt they will there will be very

1567
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:17,739
unhappy frustrated people and the

1568
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:19,510
Marxist Leninist regime does not

1569
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:23,050
tolerate these people they obviously

1570
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,139
they will join the links of dissenters

1571
01:11:25,139 --> 01:11:29,679
dissidents unlike in present United

1572
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,300
States there will be no place for

1573
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,159
dissent in future Marxist Leninist

1574
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:38,829
America here you can you can get popular

1575
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:41,409
like Daniel Ellsberg and filthy rich

1576
01:11:41,409 --> 01:11:44,170
like Jane Fonda for being dissident for

1577
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,510
criticizing your Pentagon in future

1578
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,150
these people will be simply squashed

1579
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,400
like cockroaches nobody is going to pay

1580
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,440
them nothing for their beautiful noble

1581
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,110
ideas of equality this they don't

1582
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,599
understand and it will be greatest shock

1583
01:11:58,599 --> 01:12:01,239
for them of course the demoralization

1584
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:03,590
process in the United States is based

1585
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:07,280
we completed already for the last 25

1586
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,890
years actually it's over fulfilled

1587
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,260
because demoralization now reaches such

1588
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:15,320
areas where previously not even comrade

1589
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,020
and drop of and all his experts would

1590
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,720
would even dream of such a tremendous

1591
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,080
success most of it is done by Americans

1592
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,160
to Americans

1593
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,530
thanks to lack of moral standards as I

1594
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:30,980
mentioned before exposure to true

1595
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,820
information does not matter anymore a

1596
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:37,490
person who was demoralized is unable to

1597
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:40,760
assess true information the facts tell

1598
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,270
nothing to him even if I shower him with

1599
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,490
information with the authentic proof

1600
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:49,790
with documents the pictures even if I

1601
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:51,710
take him by force to the Soviet Union

1602
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,320
and show him concentration camp he will

1603
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,710
refuse to believe it until he is going

1604
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:00,140
to receive a kick in the in his fat

1605
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,840
bottom when the military booth crashes

1606
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,360
his balls then he will understand but

1607
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,160
not before that that's the tragic of the

1608
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,040
situation of demoralisation so basically

1609
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,930
America is stuck with with

1610
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,780
demoralisation and unless even if you

1611
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,760
start right now here this minute you

1612
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,440
start educating new generation of

1613
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,960
American it will still take you 15 to 20

1614
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,820
years to turn the tide of ideological

1615
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,330
perception of reality back to normal

1616
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:32,630
normalcy and and patriotism the next

1617
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:35,210
stage is destabilization this time

1618
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,760
subvert our does not care about your

1619
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,410
ideas and the patterns of your

1620
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,240
consumption whether you eat junk food

1621
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,310
and get fat and flabby it doesn't matter

1622
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:46,190
anymore this time and it takes only from

1623
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:47,930
two to five years to disturb you lies a

1624
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:51,470
nation it's but what what matters is

1625
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,860
essentials economy Foreign Relations

1626
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:58,130
defense systems and you can see it quite

1627
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:01,580
clearly that's in some areas in such

1628
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:05,770
sensitive areas as defense and economy

1629
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:09,350
the influence of Marxist Leninist ideas

1630
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,450
in the United States is absolutely

1631
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:13,850
fantastic I could never believe it 14

1632
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:16,460
years ago when I landed in this part of

1633
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,070
the world

1634
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:20,910
that the process will go that fast the

1635
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,310
next stage of course is crisis it may

1636
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:25,890
take only up to six weeks to to bring a

1637
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,870
country to the verge of crisis you can

1638
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,110
see it in in Central America now and

1639
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:33,090
after crisis with a violent change of

1640
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,790
power structure and economy you have

1641
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:38,700
so-called the period of normalization it

1642
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,430
may last indefinitely normalization is a

1643
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:43,710
cynical expression borrowed from Soviet

1644
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,780
propaganda when the Soviet tanks moved

1645
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,360
into Czechoslovakia in 68 comrade

1646
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,790
Brezhnev said now the situation in

1647
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,250
brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized

1648
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,590
this is what will happen in the United

1649
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,660
States if you allow all the Schmucks to

1650
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,930
bring the country to crisis to promise

1651
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,820
people all kinds of goodies and the

1652
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:06,540
paradise on earth - to destabilize your

1653
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,660
economy to eliminate the principle of

1654
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,540
free market competition and to put a Big

1655
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:16,590
Brother government in Washington DC with

1656
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,020
the benevolent dictators like Walter

1657
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:22,170
Mondale who will promise lots of things

1658
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,970
never mind whether the promises are

1659
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,890
fulfilled will or not he will go to

1660
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:28,380
Moscow to kiss the bottoms of new

1661
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,990
generation of Soviet assassins never

1662
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:33,570
mind he will create false illusions that

1663
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,630
the situation is under control situation

1664
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:39,000
is not under control situation is

1665
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,910
disgustingly out of control most of the

1666
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,980
American politicians media and

1667
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,950
educational system trains and not a

1668
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,380
generation of people who think they are

1669
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:53,640
living at the peace time false United

1670
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,400
States is in the state of war undeclared

1671
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,090
total war against the basic principles

1672
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:03,020
and the foundations of this system and

1673
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:06,240
and the initiator of this war is not

1674
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,320
comrade Andropov of course it's it's the

1675
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,650
system however ridiculous it may sound

1676
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:16,290
the world communist system or the world

1677
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:18,240
communist conspiracy where they scare

1678
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,330
some people or not I don't give a hoot

1679
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:24,000
if you are not scared by now nothing can

1680
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,730
scare you but you don't have to be

1681
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:29,070
paranoid about it what what actually

1682
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,389
happens now

1683
01:16:30,389 --> 01:16:34,880
that unlike myself you have literally

1684
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,619
several years to live on unless the

1685
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:40,380
United States wake up the the time bomb

1686
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,989
is ticking with every second the

1687
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:44,909
disaster is coming closer and closer

1688
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:47,699
unlike myself you will have nowhere to

1689
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:50,969
defect to unless you want to live in

1690
01:16:50,969 --> 01:16:53,429
Antarctica with penguins this is it this

1691
01:16:53,429 --> 01:16:55,229
is the last country of freedom and

1692
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:58,949
possibility okay so what do we do what

1693
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:00,689
is your recommendation to the American

1694
01:17:00,689 --> 01:17:05,189
people well they're the the immediate

1695
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:07,139
thing that comes to my mind is of course

1696
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:10,590
there must be a very strong national

1697
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:14,729
effort to educate people in the spirit

1698
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:16,979
of real patriotism number one number two

1699
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:19,979
to to explain them the real danger of

1700
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:22,469
socialist communist whatever welfare

1701
01:17:22,469 --> 01:17:25,739
state Big Brother government if people

1702
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:28,619
will fail to grasp the impending danger

1703
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:31,979
of their development nothing ever can

1704
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,780
help United States you may kiss goodbye

1705
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,499
to your freedom including freedoms to

1706
01:17:36,499 --> 01:17:40,050
homosexuals to a prison inmate all this

1707
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:42,239
freedom will vanish evaporated in five

1708
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,800
seconds including your precious lives

1709
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,800
the second thing I the moment at least

1710
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,019
part of United States population is

1711
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:55,110
convinced that the danger is real they

1712
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,239
have to force their government and I'm

1713
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,860
not talking about sending letters

1714
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:01,289
signing petitions and all this beautiful

1715
01:18:01,289 --> 01:18:03,360
noble activity I am talking about

1716
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,780
forcing United States government to stop

1717
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:09,929
aiding communism because there is no

1718
01:18:09,929 --> 01:18:12,899
other problem more burning and urgent

1719
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:14,939
than to stop the Soviet military

1720
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:17,579
industrial complex from destroying what

1721
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:19,349
is whatever is left of the free world

1722
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:23,610
and it is very easy to do no credits no

1723
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:26,070
technology no money no political or

1724
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,229
diplomatic recognition and of course no

1725
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:31,919
such idiocy as grain deals to USSR the

1726
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:34,919
Soviet people 270 millions of Soviets

1727
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,979
will be eternally thankful to you if you

1728
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:41,070
stop aiding a bunch of murderers who sit

1729
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:43,439
now increment and whom President Reagan

1730
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:44,010
respect

1731
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:46,619
calls government they do not govern

1732
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:49,409
anything least of all such complexity as

1733
01:18:49,409 --> 01:18:52,980
the Soviet economy so basic - - very

1734
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,650
simple maybe too simplistic answers or

1735
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:57,900
solutions but never nevertheless they

1736
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,769
are the only solutions educate yourself

1737
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,969
understand what's going on around you

1738
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:04,769
you are not living at the time of peace

1739
01:19:04,769 --> 01:19:08,130
you are in a state of war and you have

1740
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:11,960
precious little time to save yourself

1741
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,579
you don't have much time especially if

1742
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:16,019
you are talking about young generation

1743
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:18,530
there's not much time left for

1744
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:22,590
convulsions and sexual masturbation -

1745
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,639
the beautiful

1746
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:26,880
disco music very soon it will go just

1747
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,690
just overnight if we are talking about

1748
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:34,139
capitalists or wealthy businessmen they

1749
01:19:34,139 --> 01:19:36,179
I think they are selling the rope on

1750
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:38,489
which they will hang very soon if they

1751
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:41,059
don't stop if they cannot curb the

1752
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:44,489
unsettle desire for profit and if they

1753
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:46,409
keep on trading with the monster of the

1754
01:19:46,409 --> 01:19:47,599
Soviet Communism

1755
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:51,269
they're going to hang very soon and they

1756
01:19:51,269 --> 01:19:53,760
will pray to be killed but unfortunately

1757
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,920
they will be sent to Alaska probably to

1758
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,730
manage industry of slaves it's it's

1759
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,980
simplistic I know it sounds unpleasant I

1760
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,869
know Americans don't like to listen to

1761
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:06,480
things which are unpleasant but I have

1762
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,369
defected not to tell you the stories

1763
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:11,730
about such agencies as microfilm James

1764
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:16,199
Bond type espionage this is garbage you

1765
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,230
don't need any espionage anymore I have

1766
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,960
come to talk about survival it's a

1767
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,739
question of survival of this system you

1768
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:28,260
may ask me what is it in for me survival

1769
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:32,309
obviously because unlike as I said I am

1770
01:20:32,309 --> 01:20:35,280
now in your boat if we sing together

1771
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,130
we'll sing beautifully together there is

1772
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,720
no other place on this planet to defect

1773
