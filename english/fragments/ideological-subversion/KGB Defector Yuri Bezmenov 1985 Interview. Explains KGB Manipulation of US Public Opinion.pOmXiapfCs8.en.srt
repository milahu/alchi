1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,040
well you spoke several times before

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,359
about ideological subversion that is a

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,799
phrase that uh I'm afraid some Americans

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,679
don't fully understand when uh the

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,080
Soviets use the phrase ideological

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,160
subversion what do they mean by it

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,320
ideological subversion is is the process

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
which is legitimate over word and open

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,560
you you can see it with your own eyes

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,560
all all you have to do all American mass

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,279
media has to do is to unplug their

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,640
bananas from their ears open up their

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,840
eyes and they can see it there is no

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,760
mystery there's nothing to do with

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,920
Espionage I know that Espionage

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,320
intelligence gathering looks more

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,399
romantic it sells more deodorant through

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,840
the advertising probably that's why your

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
Hollywood producers are so crazy about

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,120
James Bond type of of Thrillers but in

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,320
reality the main emphasis of the KGB is

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,840
not in the area of intelligence at all

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,399
according to my opinion and opinion of

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,760
many def factors of my caliber only

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,760
about 15% of time money and Manpower is

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,600
spent on Espionage as such the other 85%

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,159
is a slow process which we call either

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,960
ideological subversion or active

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,119
measures activ in the language of of the

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,159
KGB or psychological warfare what it

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
basically means is to change the

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,840
perception of reality of every

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
American to such an extent that despite

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,560
of the abundance of

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,240
information no one is able to come to

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,479
sensible conclusions in the interest of

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,840
Defending themselves their families

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,520
their community and their

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,000
country it's a great

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,200
brainwashing uh process which goes very

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,920
slow and it's divided in in four basic

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,200
stages uh the first one being

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,759
demoralization it takes from 15 to 20

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,159
years to demoralize a nation why that

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,439
many years

46
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,560
because this is the minimum number of

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,399
years which requires to educate one

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,679
generation of students in the country of

49
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,680
of of your enemy exposed to the ideology

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,920
of the enemy in other words Marxism

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,720
leninism ideology is being pumped into

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,760
the soft heads of of at least three

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
generations of American students without

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,120
being challenged or counterbalanced by

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,360
the basic values of americanism American

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
patriotism the result the result you can

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,760
see most of the people who graduated in

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,440
60s dropouts or half-baked intellectuals

59
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,720
are now occupying the positions of power

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,080
in the government civil service business

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,840
mass media educational system you are

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,040
stuck with them you cannot get rid of

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,239
them they are contaminated they are

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,519
programmed to think and react to certain

65
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,480
stimuli in a certain pattern you cannot

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
change their mind even if you if you

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
expose them to authentic information

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,200
even if you prove that why white is

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,480
white and black is black you still

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,239
cannot change the basic perception and

71
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,120
the logic of behavior and another words

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,319
these people uh uh the process of

73
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,400
demoralization is complete and

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,879
irreversible to get rid Society of these

75
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,879
people you have you need another 20 or

76
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,879
or or 15 years to educate a new

77
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,519
generation of patriotically minded and

78
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,439
and and uh common common sense people

79
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,319
who would be acting in favor and in the

80
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,080
interests of of the of the United States

81
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,159
society and yet these people who' been

82
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,480
programmed and as you say in place and

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,159
who are favorable to an opening with the

84
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,360
Soviet concept these are the very people

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,400
who would be marked for extermination in

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,920
this country most of them yes uh simply

87
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,280
because the psychological shock when

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,680
when they will see in future what the

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,879
what the beautiful Society of equality

90
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,799
and social justice means in practice

91
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,239
obviously they will Revolt they they

92
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
will they will be very unhappy

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,319
frustrated people and the Marxist

94
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,159
leninist regime does not tolerate these

95
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,720
people uh they obviously they will join

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
the links of denters dissidents yes uh

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,279
unlike in present United States there

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
will be no place for descent in in

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,840
future Marxist leninist America uh here

100
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,639
you can you can get uh popular like

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
Daniel ellberg and Filthy Rich like Jane

102
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,240
Fonda for being dissident for

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,639
criticizing your Pentagon in Future

104
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,360
these people will be simply squashed

105
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,520
like cockroaches nobody's going to pay

106
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,759
them nothing for their beautiful Noble

107
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,639
ideas of equality this they don't

108
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,400
understand and uh it will be greatest

109
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
shock for them of course the

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
demoralization process in the United

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,199
States is basically completed already uh

112
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
for the last 25 years actually it's over

113
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,759
fulfilled because demoralization now

114
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,759
reaches such areas where previously not

115
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
even comrad andropov and and all his

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,280
experts would would even dream of such a

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,639
tremendous success most of it is done by

118
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,280
Americans to Americans thanks to lack of

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,600
moral standards as I mentioned before uh

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,440
exposure to True information does not

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,919
matter anymore a person who was

122
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,840
demoralized is unable to assess true

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,840
information the facts tell nothing to

124
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,560
him uh even if I shower him with

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,800
information with with authentic proof

126
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,960
with documents with pictures even if I

127
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
take him by force to the Soviet Union

128
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
and show him concentration camp he will

129
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,759
refuse to believe it until he he's going

130
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,360
to receive a kick in the in his fat

131
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,919
bottom when a military boot crashes his

132
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,080
then he will understand but not before

133
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,759
that that's the tragic of the situation

134
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,440
of demoralization so basically American

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,039
Amica is stuck with with demoralization

136
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,520
and unless even if if you start right

137
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,720
now here this minute you start educating

138
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,759
new generation of American it will still

139
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,560
take you 15 to 20 years to turn the tide

140
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
of uh of ideological perception of

141
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
reality uh back to normal normaly and

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,280
and

143
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,919
patriotism the next stage is

144
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,759
destabilization this time subverter does

145
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,840
not care about your ideas and the

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
patterns of your consumption whether you

147
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,919
eat junk food and get fat and flab it

148
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,599
doesn't matter anymore this time and it

149
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,400
takes only from 2 to 5 years to

150
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
destabilize a nation uh it's what what

151
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
matters is Essentials economy Foreign

152
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,080
Relations defense

153
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,360
systems uh and you can see it quite

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,759
clearly that in some areas uh in such

155
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,800
sensitive areas as as uh defense and

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,560
economy the influence of marxist

157
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,919
leninist ideas in the United States is

158
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,160
absolutely fantastic I I could never

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,840
believe it 14 years ago when I landed uh

160
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,879
in this part of the world that the

161
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,759
process will go that

162
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,080
fast uh the next stage of course is

163
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Crisis it it it may take only up to six

164
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
weeks to to bring a country to the verge

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,199
of Crisis you can see it in in Central

166
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,240
America now and after crisis with a

167
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,960
violent change of of power structure and

168
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,720
economy you have so-called the period of

169
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,599
normalization it may last indefinitely

170
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,879
normalization is a cynical expression

171
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,039
borrowed from Soviet propaganda when the

172
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,039
Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia

173
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,759
in ' 68 comr BR said now the situation

174
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,240
in brotherly Czechoslovakia is

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
normalized this is what will happen in

176
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,159
United States if you allow all the

177
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,360
Schmucks to bring the country to

178
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,159
crisis to promise people all kind of

179
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,400
goodies and the paradise on Earth uh to

180
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,960
to destabilize your economy to eliminate

181
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,440
the principle of free market competition

182
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,720
and to put a big brother government in

183
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,960
Washington DC with the benevolent

184
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
dictators Like Walter Mondale who will

185
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,120
promise lots of things never mind

186
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,919
whether the promises are fulfilled or

187
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,240
not he will go to Moscow to kiss the

188
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,919
bottoms of of new generation of Soviet

189
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,639
assassins never mind he will create

190
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,360
false illusions that the situation is

191
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,800
under control situation is not under

192
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,479
control situation is disgustingly out of

193
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,479
control most of the American politicians

194
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,679
media and educational system trains

195
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,080
another generation of people who think

196
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,320
they are living at a peace time false

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
United States is in the state of War UND

198
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,600
declared total war against the basic

199
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
principles and the foundations of of

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,800
this

201
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,000
system and and the initiator of this war

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,360
is not comrad andropov of

203
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,279
course uh it's it's the

204
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,959
system however ridiculous it may sound

205
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
the world communist system or the world

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
communist conspiracy whether I scar some

207
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,600
people are not I don't give a hood uh if

208
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,120
if you are not scared by now nothing can

209
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,839
scare you but you don't have to be

210
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,399
paranoid about it what what actually

211
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,519
happens now that unlike myself you

212
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,240
have literally several years to live on

213
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
unless the United States wake up the the

214
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,959
time bomb is ticking with every second

215
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,480
the disaster is coming closer and closer

216
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,160
unlike myself you will have nowhere to

217
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,120
defect to unless you want to live in

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Antarctica with penguins this is it this

219
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,360
is the last country of freedom and and

220
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
possibility okay so what do we do what

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,839
is your recommendation to the American

222
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,320
people well uh the the um the immediate

223
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,839
thing that comes to my mind is of course

224
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,079
there must be a very strong National

225
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,640
effort to educate people in in in the

226
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,800
spirit of real patriotism number one

227
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,640
number two to to explain them the real

228
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
danger of Socialist Communist whatever

229
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
welfare state Big Brother government if

230
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,360
people will fail to grasp the impending

231
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,920
danger of that development nothing ever

232
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,720
can help United States you make his

233
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,440
goodbye to your freedom including

234
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,240
freedoms to to homosexuals to prison

235
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
inmate all the Freedom will vanish

236
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,079
evaporating in 5 seconds including your

237
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,200
precious

238
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,800
lives um the second thing I the moment

239
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
at least part of United States

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,240
population is convinced that the danger

241
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,720
is real they have to force their

242
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
government and I'm not talking about

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
sending letters signing petitions and

244
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
all this beautiful Noble activity I'm

245
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,560
talking about forcing United States

246
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
government to stop aiding

247
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
communism because there is no no other

248
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
problem more burning and and urgent than

249
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,920
to stop the Soviet military industrial

250
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,399
complex from destroying what is whatever

251
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,040
is left of the Free World and it is very

252
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,839
easy to do no credits no technology no

253
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,920
money no political or diplomatic

254
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,279
recognition and of course no such ID as

255
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,920
grain deals to

256
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
USSR the Soviet people 270 millions of

257
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
of Soviets will be eternally thankful to

258
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
you if you stop aiding a bunch of

259
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,600
murderers who sit now in Kremlin and

260
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,279
whom president dragan respectfully calls

261
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,519
government they do not govern anything

262
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,720
list of all such complexity as the

263
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
Soviet economy so basic two two very

264
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,000
simple maybe two simplistic answers or

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,120
Solutions but never nevertheless they

266
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,680
are the only solutions educate yourself

267
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,160
understand what's going on around you

268
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,519
you are not living at the time of Peace

269
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,360
you are in a state of war and you have

270
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,120
precious little time to save

271
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,200
yourself um you don't have much time

272
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,360
especially if you're are talking about

273
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,480
Young Generation there's not much time

274
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
left for

275
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,600
convulsions to the beautiful uh disco

276
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,079
music very soon it will go just just

277
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,120
overnight if we are talking about

278
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,240
capitalists or or or wealthy

279
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,120
businessmen they I think they are

280
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
selling the Rope on which they will hang

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,000
very soon if they don't stop if they can

282
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,199
not curb their unsettle desire for

283
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,760
profit and if they keep on trading with

284
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,519
the monster of the Soviet

285
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,959
communism they are going to hang very

286
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,079
soon and it they will pray to be killed

287
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
but unfortunately they will be sent to

288
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
Alaska probably to manage industry of

289
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,959
slaves it's it's simplistic I know it

290
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,199
sounds unpleasant I know Americans don't

291
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,160
like to listen to things which are

292
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,519
unpleasant but I have defected not to

293
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,880
tell you the stories about such idiocy

294
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
is as microfilm James Bond type

295
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
Espionage this is

296
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,079
garbage uh you don't need any Espionage

297
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,959
anymore I have come to talk about

298
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,360
survival it's a question of survival of

299
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
this

300
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
system you may ask me what is it in for

301
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,800
me survival obviously because unlike I

302
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,839
as I said I am now in your boat if if we

303
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,320
sing together we will sing beautifully

304
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
together there is no other place on the

305
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,079
this planet to defect

306
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,470
[Music]

307
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,519
