soviet army

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
picture taken at the entrance of my

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,680
institute of oriental languages it's a

unquote volunteering

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
for harvesting grain in kazakhstan

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
by the end of my training in school i

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
was recruited by the kgb

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
this picture was taken on that day and

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,559
you can see again how happy

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,680
it feels to be recruited by the kgb

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,199
pay special attention to number of

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,280
bottles on the table one of my functions

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,120
was to keep foreign guests

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,438
permanently intoxicated the moment they

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,920
land at moscow airport

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
in 1967 the kgb attached me to this

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,080
magazine look magazine a group of 12

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,560
people

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
arrived to ussr from united states to

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,000
cover

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
the 50th anniversary of october

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
socialist revolution in my country

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
from the first page to the last page it

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
was a package of lies

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:39,709
[Music]

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,680
[Music]

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
our conversation is with mr yuri

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
alexandrovich besmianov

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
mr besvanov was born in 1939

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
in a suburb of moscow he was the son of

40
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,960
a high-ranking soviet army officer

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
he was educated in the elite schools

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,799
inside the soviet union and became an

43
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,600
expert in

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,799
indian culture and indian languages

45
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
he had an outstanding career with

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,560
novastie which was the

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
pr and still is i should say the press

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
arm or the press agency of the soviet

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
union it turns out that this is also a

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,599
front

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,400
for the kgb one of his interesting

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
assignments was to brainwash

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
foreign diplomats when they visited

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
moscow and

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
he'll tell us a little bit about how

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
they did this and how they planted

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,840
information which eventually wound up in

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
the press of the free world

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
he escaped to the west in 1970 after

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
becoming totally disgusted with the

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
soviet system

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
and he did this at great risk to his

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,200
life

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,480
he certainly is one of the world's

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
outstanding experts on the subject of

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
soviet propaganda

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,280
and disinformation and active measures

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
mr besmianov i'd like to begin by having

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
you tell us a little bit about some of

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
your childhood memories

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
well the most vivid memory of my

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
childhood was second world war

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
or to be more precise the end of the

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
second world war when all of a sudden

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,239
united states from a friendly uh

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,360
nation which helped us to defeat

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
nazism turned overnight into a deadly

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
enemy

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
and it was very shocking because all

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
newspapers

81
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
were trying to present an image of

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
belligerent aggressive american

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,560
imperialism

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
most of the things that we were taught

85
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,599
is that united states

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,040
is aggressive power which is just about

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
to invade our beautiful

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,400
free socialist country uh that american

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
cia

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
is dropping colorado beetles on our

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
beautiful potato fields

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,319
to eliminate our crops and each

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
schoolboy had a

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
picture of colorado bug on the on the

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
back page of his

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,080
notebook and we were instructed to go

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
into collective fields

98
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840
to search for those little colorado bugs

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
of course we couldn't find any

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
neither we could find many potatoes and

101
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
that was explained again by the

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
encroachments

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,720
of the decadent imperialist power

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,159
the anti-american paranoia hysteria in

105
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
in the soviet propaganda was to such an

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,439
a

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,720
of such a higher degree that many

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
less skeptical people or less stubborn

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,839
would really believe that united states

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,240
is just about to invade our beautiful

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
motherland

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,600
and some secretly hope that it will come

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
true

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
that's interesting yes well getting back

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
to

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,280
life inside the soviet union or inside

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
communist countries in general in this

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
country

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
at the university level primarily we

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,360
read and hear

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
that uh the soviet system is different

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
from ours but not that different

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
and that there is a convergence

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
developing between

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
all of the systems of the world and that

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,320
really doesn't make an awful lot of

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
difference what system you live under

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,000
because

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
you have corruption and dishonesty and

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,280
tyranny and

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
all that sort of thing from your

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
personal experience what is the

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
difference between life under communism

134
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
and life in the united states

135
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
well life is obviously very much

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,800
different for simple reason that

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
the soviet union is a state

138
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,479
capitalist economically it's a state

139
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,600
capitalism

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
where an individual has absolutely no

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
rights no value his life is nothing it's

142
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,759
just like an insect

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,400
he is disposable whereby in the united

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
states even the

145
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,600
even the worst criminal is treated as a

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,720
human being

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,039
he has a fair trial and some of them

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
capitalize on their crimes they they

149
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,680
publish their memoirs in their prisons

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
and get handsomely paid by your crazy

151
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
publishers

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
the differences of course in the daily

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,280
life

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
are very various depending on who

155
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
whom we are talking about in my own

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
private life i never suffered from

157
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
communism simply because i was brought

158
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,000
up in the family

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
of high ranking military officer

160
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
most of the doors were open for me most

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,600
of my expenses were paid by the

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,639
government

163
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,880
and i never had any troubles in with the

164
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
authorities or

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
with the police so in other words i i

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,759
would say i

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,199
i enjoyed or i had good reasons to enjoy

168
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,840
all the advantages of so-called

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
socialists

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,199
system my main

171
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
motivations to defect was had nothing to

172
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,039
do with affluence

173
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,240
it was mainly moral indignation moral

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,800
protest

175
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
rebellion against the inhuman methods of

176
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,759
of the soviet system

177
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,720
well specifically what did you object to

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
i objected first of all

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
against oppression of my own dissidents

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
and intellectuals and that was the most

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
disgusting thing that that i witnessed

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,240
as a

183
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,560
as a young man young student who was

184
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,520
brought up

185
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
a very troublesome period in our history

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
from stalin to khrushchev

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,520
from total tyranny and oppression to

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,800
some kind of liberalization second

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
when i started working for the soviet

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
embassy in india

191
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
i to my horror i discovered that we are

192
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,039
millions times more oppressive than any

193
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,240
colonial or

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
imperialist power in the history of

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
mankind

196
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,919
that my country brings to india not

197
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,479
freedom

198
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
progress and friendship between the

199
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
nations

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
but racism exploitation

201
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,240
and slavery and and of course economical

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
inefficiency to this country

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
since i fell in love with india i i

204
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
developed something which by kgb

205
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,479
standards is extremely dangerous thing

206
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
it's called split loyalty when an agent

207
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,000
likes a country

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
of assignment more than his own country

209
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,160
i literally fell in love with this

210
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
beautiful country

211
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,319
a country of great contrasts but also

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,800
great humility great tolerance and and

213
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
if philosophical and intellectual

214
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
freedoms my ancestors used to live in

215
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
caves and eat raw meat when

216
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,919
india was highly civilized nation six

217
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,440
thousand years ago

218
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,319
so obviously the choice was not to the

219
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,840
advantage of my own nation

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,360
i decided to defect and to entirely

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
dissociate myself from that brutal

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
regime

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
mr besmianov we've read a lot about the

224
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,000
concentration camps and the slave labor

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
camps under the stalin regime

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
now the general impression in america is

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
that those things are part of the past

228
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
are they still going on today or what is

229
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
the status yes

230
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,799
there is no qualitative change in in the

231
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,080
soviet concentration camp system

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
there are changes in in numbers of

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
prisoners

234
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
again this is uh unreliable soviet

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,560
statistics

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
we don't know how many political

237
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
prisoners are there in the soviet

238
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
concentration camps

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
but we sure know from from various

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
sources

241
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
that at each particular time there are

242
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
close to

243
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
25 to 30 million of soviet citizens who

244
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
are virtually kept as slaves in forced

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,640
labor

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,920
camp system the size of the population

247
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
of

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
country like canada is serving terms

249
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
as prisoners incredible so

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
um i would say that

251
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
those intellectuals who try to convince

252
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,480
american public that concentration camp

253
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,440
system is

254
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,839
a thing of a past are either

255
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,360
conscientiously misleading public

256
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
opinion

257
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,000
or they are not in very intellectual

258
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,959
people they

259
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,000
they're selectively blind they don't

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
they lack

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
um intellectual honesty when they say

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,519
that

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,560
well we've spoken about the

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
intellectuals in this country and also

265
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
the intellectuals

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
in the soviet union what about down

267
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,160
at the broad mass level do the

268
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
people in general the worker and the

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
working people the workers in general

270
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
and the soviet union do they support the

271
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
system do they tolerate it

272
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
what is their attitude well average

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
soviet citizen if there is such an

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
animal of course

275
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
does not like the system because it

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,480
hurts

277
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
it kills he may not understand the

278
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
the reasons he may not have enough

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,800
information

280
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,680
or or educational background to

281
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
understand

282
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
but i doubt very much there are many

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
people who are conscientiously

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
supporting the soviet system that are

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,399
not such

286
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
such people in ussr even those who have

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
all the reasons to enjoy socialism

288
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
people like myself

289
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,680
were a member of journalistic elite uh

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,399
they

291
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,880
they also hate system for for different

292
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
reasons though not because they lack

293
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
material affluence

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
but because they are unfree to think

295
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
they're in constant fear

296
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
duplicity split personality and this is

297
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
the greatest tragedy for my nation

298
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
well what do you think are the chances

299
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
of the people actually

300
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,160
overcoming their system or replacing it

301
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,279
there is a great possibility that system

302
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,880
will sooner or later

303
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,360
be destroyed from within that is a

304
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,279
self-destructive mechanism

305
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,079
built in into any socialist or communist

306
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,240
or fascist system

307
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
because there is lack of feedback

308
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
because the system does not

309
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,800
rely upon loyalty of population

310
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,880
but until and until this soviet junta is

311
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,399
being supported

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,959
by the western so-called imperialists

313
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,000
that is

314
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,120
multinational companies establishments

315
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,959
governments and let's face it

316
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,839
intellectuals so-called academia in the

317
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
united states is famous for supporting

318
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
the soviet system

319
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
as long as the soviet junta will keep on

320
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
receiving credits

321
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,399
money technology grain deals and

322
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,920
political recognition

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
from all these traitors of democracy or

324
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,279
freedom

325
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
uh there is no hope there is not much

326
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,800
hope for

327
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,920
for changes in my country

328
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
and the system will not collapse by

329
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,839
itself

330
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,800
simply because it's being nourished by

331
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,959
so-called american imperialism this is

332
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,320
the greatest

333
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
paradox in history of mankind when a

334
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,720
capitalist world supports

335
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,000
and actively nourishes its own destruct

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,959
destroyer destructor

337
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,000
i think you're trying to tell us

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,560
something oh yes

339
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,880
i'm trying to tell you that it has to be

340
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
stopped unless you want to end up in

341
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
in gulag system and enjoy all the

342
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
advantages of socialist

343
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,519
equality uh working for free

344
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
catching fleas on your body sleeping on

345
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
on the

346
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
planks of plywood in in alaska this time

347
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
i guess

348
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
that's where americans will belong

349
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
unless they will wake up of course and

350
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
force their government to stop aiding

351
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
soviet fascism

352
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
well you told us a moment ago why you

353
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
left the system

354
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
i'd like to hear the details of how you

355
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,560
did it it must have been a very

356
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
dangerous thing

357
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,120
it was not so dangerous it was crazy

358
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,000
first of all because defecting in india

359
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
is virtually

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
impossible thanks to very strong

361
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
pressure from the soviet government

362
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
excuse me you were in india on

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
assignment yes i was working for the

364
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,399
soviet embassy in new delhi

365
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,760
as a press officer and

366
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,040
uh defecting for a soviet diplomat

367
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
is next to impossible it's a suicide as

368
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
i said because

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,399
a great friend indira gandhi

370
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,480
pushed a law through parliament which

371
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
says and i quote

372
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
no defector from any country has a right

373
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,320
of political asylum

374
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,399
in any embassy on the territory of

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,760
indian republic

376
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,320
which is a masterpiece of hypocrisy no

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
other defector but the soviet one

378
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,680
needs a political asylum so knowing that

379
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,959
perfectly well

380
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,639
i i i planned a craziest

381
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,079
possible way to defect i studied counter

382
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,880
culture in

383
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,240
india there are there were thousands of

384
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,360
young american boys and girls with no

385
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
shoes long hair

386
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,920
smoking hush and marijuana studying

387
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
sometimes

388
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
indian philosophy sometimes simply

389
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
pretending that they study

390
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,440
and they greatly annoyed indian police

391
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,079
and they were laughing stock of indians

392
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,399
because obviously they were good for

393
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
nothing students

394
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
i studied carefully where they

395
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,800
congregate what routes they travel what

396
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,360
language they speak what do they smoke

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,079
and one day i simply joined a group of

398
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,880
hippies

399
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,079
to avoid detection of indian police

400
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
i was dressed as a typical hippie with

401
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
blue jeans

402
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,040
long cummies shirts with all kind of

403
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,000
nice

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,519
decorations like beads long hairs

405
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,560
uh i i bought a wig because for several

406
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
weeks i had to turn myself from a

407
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
conservative soviet diplomat

408
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,839
into a very progressive american hippie

409
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,399
and that was the only way that that i

410
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:26,880
could

411
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,000
uh avoid detection

412
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,040
it was very interesting experience

413
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,560
but it was necessary because um from my

414
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,519
own knowledge

415
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,720
as a member of soviet embassy staff

416
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,279
i knew that there were many cases when

417
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,000
soviet defectors were betrayed by

418
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
indian police and also some western

419
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,320
embassies played a very dirty

420
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,279
role in betraying the soviet defectors

421
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
according to our information

422
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
they were some i wouldn't call them

423
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
double agents but simply

424
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
a moral people working for this

425
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
for the united states embassy and uh

426
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
confining in in people like this would

427
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
be a suicide

428
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,279
so i had to be extremely careful i could

429
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
not trust anyone

430
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
uh and that was the that was the reason

431
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,279
for such a crazy way to defect well had

432
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
you been

433
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,519
caught in the act of trying to get out

434
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,880
what would have happened to you

435
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,079
oh most likely i would i end up in in

436
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,279
concentration camp

437
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
or depending on the situation and

438
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
on the on the whim of some bureaucrat

439
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
and kgb

440
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,320
uh maybe even executed that this is

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,360
normal practice

442
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,800
quietly of course not publicly

443
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,160
but that would be the end of my

444
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
defection of course well

445
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
when did you finally make it to the

446
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
united states uh

447
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
in 1970 after about

448
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,480
six months of debriefing in athens by

449
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,839
the cia

450
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
and i presume fbi too they let me go

451
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
first to germany then to canada that was

452
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,039
my decision i had to change my identity

453
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
to protect my family

454
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,160
and my friends in ussr

455
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,359
and also i was little bit paranoid

456
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,959
uh knowing that both soviet kgb

457
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,520
and probably some double agents within

458
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,839
american system may be after me

459
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,320
so i wanted to settle down as far away

460
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,919
as possible

461
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,440
i requested cia to give me some kind of

462
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
new identity and just let me go

463
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,400
on my own and i settled in canada i was

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
a student

465
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,000
i changed many professions from

466
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,039
farm help and and laundry truck driver

467
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,039
to instruct language instructor and

468
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
broadcaster for canadian broadcasting

469
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,400
corporations in montreal have you had

470
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
any threats on your life or any uh

471
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,679
yeah uh in about five years kgb

472
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,440
eventually discovered that i'm working

473
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,520
for canadian broadcasting

474
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,679
uh see i made a very big mistake i

475
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,240
started talk i started working for

476
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
overseas service of cbc which is similar

477
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,919
to

478
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
voice of america in russian language and

479
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,559
of course

480
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,880
monitoring service in ussr picked up

481
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
every new

482
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,679
voice uh every new announcer would

483
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,440
they they would make it a point to

484
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,679
discover who he is and in five years

485
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
sure enough slowly but surely they

486
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,360
discovered that i am

487
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
not thomas schuman that i am yuri

488
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
aleksandrovich bismianov and the time

489
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
working for canadian broadcasting

490
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
and undermining beautiful the town

491
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,640
between canada and ussr

492
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
and the soviet ambassador alexander

493
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
yakovlev

494
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
made it his personal effort to discredit

495
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,840
me he complained to pierre trudeau who

496
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,039
is known to be

497
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,840
a little bit soft on socialism and

498
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,919
the management of cbc behaved in a very

499
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
strange cowardly way unbecoming to

500
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
representatives of a

501
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,320
independent country like canada

502
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
they listened to every suggestion that

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
soviet ambassador gave

504
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,440
and they started shameful investigation

505
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,919
analyzing content of my broadcasts to

506
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,280
ussr

507
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,120
sure enough they discovered that some of

508
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
my statements were probably

509
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,640
to would be

510
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,240
offending to the soviet politburo

511
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
so i had to to leave my my job and of

512
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
course subtle intimidations they would

513
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,919
say something like please cross the

514
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,679
street carefully because you know

515
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,559
traffic is very heavy in quebec and

516
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,200
fortunately i know about the psychology

517
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
and

518
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
the logic of activity of the kgb and i

519
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,200
never allowed myself to be intimidated

520
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,559
this is the worst thing this is what

521
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
they expect a person a defector to be

522
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
intimidated once they spot that that you

523
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,480
are scared

524
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
they keep on developing that line and

525
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,760
then

526
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,200
uh eventually you either have to give up

527
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
entirely and and work for them

528
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
or you they neutralize you they they

529
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,760
would

530
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
definitely stop all kind of political

531
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
activity

532
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
which they failed to do in my case

533
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
because i was stubbornly

534
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,080
working for the canadian broadcasting

535
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
and

536
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
in response to their intimidations i

537
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
said that look this is a free country

538
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,600
and

539
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,080
i am as free as you are and i also can

540
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
drive very fast

541
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,400
and gun control is not yet established

542
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,640
in canada so i had a couple of good

543
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,360
shotguns

544
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,640
in my basement so welcome to visit me

545
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,240
someday

546
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,039
with your kalashnikov's machine guns so

547
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,200
obviously it didn't work intimidation

548
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,240
didn't work

549
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,360
so they they tried different approach

550
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,679
as i described they approached on the

551
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,799
highest level

552
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
on the level of canadian bureaucracy

553
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,159
and that level they were on that level

554
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,440
they were successful on

555
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
individual level they failed flat

556
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
mr besmianov has brought a series of

557
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,280
slides with him that he has taken

558
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,360
from the soviet union and i think this

559
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
is a good time to

560
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
take a look at the slides now the

561
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,400
viewers will be able to see these slides

562
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
as we talk about them yes this is a

563
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,679
collection of slides which are

564
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,640
some of them are snapshots from my

565
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
family album some of them are documents

566
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,960
which i smuggled from the soviet embassy

567
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
and some are reproductions from local

568
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
mass media i usually show them

569
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
to establish my credibility as a de

570
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,440
facto this is a picture of my

571
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
native town metish about 20 miles not

572
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
from moscow

573
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,679
characteristically there's a statue of

574
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
comrade lenin in the central square

575
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,880
this is myself at the age of seven again

576
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
characteristically on the statue of

577
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
comrade stalin

578
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,120
extending his friendly hand to peoples

579
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,640
of the world

580
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,280
at that age of course uh i was still

581
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,159
idealistically minded young communist

582
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,320
and um i still believe that sooner or

583
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
later things will go for better

584
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,159
but i realized that the system stinks

585
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,760
that something is fishy

586
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,960
and that ideology is is fake

587
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
and the uh propaganda about that

588
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
advanced soviet agriculture simply

589
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,919
didn't meet the criteria of reality

590
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,320
if they talk about uh abundance of food

591
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
and there's none

592
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,039
in the stores there must be something

593
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
wrong

594
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
my father was he is on the left here my

595
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,840
father was

596
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,440
officer of the general staff of the

597
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,000
soviet army he was inspector of land

598
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,960
forces

599
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,799
soviet troops stationed in countries

600
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
like mongolia cuba

601
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,000
east european countries were here alive

602
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,559
today

603
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,240
most likely he would be inspecting

604
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,120
soviet troops in in nicaragua angola

605
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,280
and many other parts of the world

606
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,640
fortunately he died

607
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
and he didn't see the disgrace because

608
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,159
deep inside he was

609
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,720
a russian patriot he didn't he didn't

610
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
like the idea of expanding soviet

611
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,000
military might

612
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
especially in the areas where we were

613
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
not welcomed at all

614
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
unlike many other military officers he

615
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
was reporting directly to the minister

616
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,360
of defense

617
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,480
bypassing kgb and diplomatic service in

618
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
other words he was a trusted

619
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,720
military professional and my impression

620
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
that this type of people

621
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,440
are much less hawkish and adventuristic

622
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
than party bureaucrats

623
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
in kremlin when american mass media

624
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
describes soviet military as potentially

625
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,919
dangerous counterpart for

626
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,120
for pentagon i simply laugh because i

627
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,080
know better

628
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
i know that the most dangerous part of

629
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
the soviet power structures

630
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,919
are not military at all most likely if

631
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,520
they come to power in my country there

632
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
will be more sensible

633
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,600
negotiators for nuclear disarmament and

634
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
withdrawal of the soviet troops from

635
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
many parts of the world but if someone

636
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,919
from the

637
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,320
party structure or the kgb structure

638
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,919
were to give the orders

639
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,159
for military they have to obey as far as

640
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,159
their their professional military

641
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,400
but they you see the triangle of power

642
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
and hate in ussr is the party at the top

643
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
the party elite the oligarchy of the

644
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,159
party then the military and the kgb at

645
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,200
the bottom

646
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,240
they hate each other and the the most

647
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
hated

648
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,520
triangle the most hated corner of the

649
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,360
triangle is the communist party

650
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,720
bureaucrats

651
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,640
they are the most adventuristic senile

652
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
megalomaniacs

653
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,559
they can start war i wouldn't be

654
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,480
surprised not the military

655
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
they know what war is yes at least my

656
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
father did

657
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,080
this is the picture taken at the at the

658
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,440
entrance of my

659
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,760
institute of oriental languages it's a

660
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,000
part of moscow state university

661
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,520
i graduated in 1963

662
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,120
and i just excuse me which one were you

663
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,520
on i i'm on the right you're on the

664
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
right and on the left is my

665
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,159
uh call my schoolmate vadim smirnov who

666
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:10,960
later was a

667
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
aparachid in the central committee of

668
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,000
the soviet

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,760
union communist party what is an

670
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
apparatchik it's it's a

671
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
it's a function it's something like

672
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,080
civil service in british empire

673
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
some someone who is never fired from

674
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
from the service he stays there

675
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,559
internally

676
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,640
he may not be promoted to high but he's

677
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
a dependable

678
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,400
bureaucrat who will stay forever

679
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,880
i started not only languages but also

680
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,159
history literature

681
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,039
even music i'm on this picture i'm

682
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,000
trying to learn

683
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
how to play musical in indian musical

684
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
instrument

685
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
i haven't tried to look like an indian

686
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,600
when i was second year students not bad

687
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,159
right

688
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,039
uh yes and actually it was strongly

689
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,080
encouraged by the

690
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
by the instructors in my school because

691
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
these the graduates of my school were

692
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
later on employed as

693
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,720
diplomats foreign journalists or spies

694
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,760
as every soviet student i was quote

695
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
unquote volunteering for

696
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,120
harvesting grain in kazakhstan this is a

697
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,480
biggest agricultural blunder of the

698
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
soviet government

699
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,039
but i didn't have much choice of course

700
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
because the communist motto borrowed

701
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
from the bible says those who do not

702
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,080
work

703
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,159
shall not eat and you can see me eating

704
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,640
therefore i was working and you can see

705
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,960
how happy i was about it

706
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,120
i went through a very extensive physical

707
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
and military training

708
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
including the manure including the

709
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,320
military games in

710
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,400
areas suburban areas of moscow

711
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
and here for example we are on the tour

712
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
in arkhangelsk area

713
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
and by the end of my training in school

714
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,559
i was recruited by the kgb this picture

715
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,400
was taken on that day and you can see

716
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,760
again how happy

717
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,039
it feels to be recruited by the kgb

718
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,360
our conversation with yuri alexandrovich

719
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,480
besmianov

720
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
who is a defector from the soviet union

721
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
a former propaganda agent

722
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,919
for navasti and the kgb will continue

723
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,840
after this message

724
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:33,960
[Music]

725
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,720
[Music]

726
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,159
all right as every student in ussr i

727
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,880
i went through very extensive physical

728
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
and military training

729
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
and civil defense training too unlike in

730
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
united states

731
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
where civil defense is virtually

732
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,440
non-existent

733
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,200
zero in ussr every student

734
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
whatever is major subject has to go

735
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,880
through very extensive four-year

736
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
military and civil defense training

737
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
you can see me here with the group of

738
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
students during one of the war games in

739
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
near moscow the

740
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,720
main idea of course is to prepare a

741
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,559
huge reserve army of of the ussr

742
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,279
each student has to to graduate as a

743
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,480
junior lieutenant

744
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
in my case it was administrative and

745
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
military

746
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,640
intelligence service my first assignment

747
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,200
was to

748
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,279
india as a translator with the soviet

749
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,640
economical aid group

750
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,600
building refinery complexes in bihar

751
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
state and gujarat state

752
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,720
at that time i was still naively

753
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,799
idealistically believing that what i was

754
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,640
doing contributes to the

755
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,480
understanding and cooperation between

756
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,919
the nations

757
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,240
uh it took me quite a number of years to

758
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,080
realize that what we were bringing to

759
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,120
india was

760
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,559
a new type of colonialism thousand times

761
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,760
more oppressive and

762
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,360
exploitative than any colonialism or

763
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,559
imperialism in history of mankind

764
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,039
but at that time i was still hoping that

765
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,120
well maybe it's not that bad could be

766
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,919
worse and things may go for better

767
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,559
and i even tried to implement the

768
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,039
beautiful marxist motor proletarians of

769
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
all the countries unite

770
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,960
i tried to unite with the nice indian

771
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,080
girl

772
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,720
and i was actually i was fascinated by

773
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
indian culture by

774
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,720
by the family life in in this country

775
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
but obviously communist party had

776
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,919
different plans for my genes

777
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,480
so i had to marry this beautiful russian

778
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,679
girl

779
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,000
in the span of my career i married three

780
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,799
times

781
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,880
most of these marriages were marriages

782
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,240
of convenience

783
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,919
on advice from the department of

784
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,159
personnel this is normal practice in

785
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,080
ussr when a soviet citizen

786
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,880
is assigned to a foreign job he has to

787
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,159
be married

788
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,039
either to keep family in ussr as

789
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,159
hostages or

790
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
if it's a convenience marriage like mine

791
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,120
uh so that the husband and wife are

792
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
virtually informers on

793
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,000
each other to prevent defection or

794
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,399
contamination by decadent imperialist or

795
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,840
capitalist ideas

796
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,480
in my case i hated that girl so much

797
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,279
that the moment i landed in moscow we

798
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,880
we were divorced and i i married

799
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
later second time by the end of my first

800
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,080

press agency which is a propaganda and

813
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,039
ideological subversion front for the kgb

assigned to specific operations in this

820
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,000
particular case you can see me talking

821
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,320
to

822
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,919
students of lumumba friendship

823
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,760
university in moscow

824
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,039
um this is the you know a huge school

825
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,399
under the direct control of the kgb and

826
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,840
central community

827
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
where future leaders of the so-called

828
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
national liberation movements are being

829
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
educated

830
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,559
and selected carefully and some of them

831
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,080
have absolutely

832
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
neither this for example is a group of

833
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,600
students from lumumba they don't look

834
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,279
like students at all they look more like

835
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,880
military and that's exactly what they

836
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,519
were

837
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,880
they were dispatched back to their

838
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,440
countries to be leaders of the

839
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
so-called national liberation movements

840
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
or to be translated into normal human

841
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,640
language

842
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,279
leaders of international terrorist

843
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,880
groups

844
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,559
another uh area of activity

845
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,720
when i was working for the nova sc was

846
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,480
to accompany groups of so-called

847
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,159
progressive intellectuals

848
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,000

849
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,080

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,440
second on the left

852
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,600
with a group of pakistani and indian

853
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,159
intellectuals

854
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,760
most of them pretended they don't

855
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,519
understand that

856
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,519
we are actually working on behalf of the

857
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,000
soviet government and the kgb

858
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,399
they pretended that they are actually

859
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,440
being guests

860
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,919
a vip intellectuals that they are

861
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,240
treated according to their merits and

862
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,039
and their intellectual abilities for us

863
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,840
they were just

864
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,559
a bunch of political prostitutes to be

865
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,840
taken advantage for various propaganda

866
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,880
operations therefore you can see

867
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,399
perfectly well

868
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,519
the senior colleague of mine on the left

869
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,679
doesn't really have that much respect on

870
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,640
his face

871
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,480
and myself with a very skeptical smile

872
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
typical kgb sarcastic smile anticipating

873
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
another victim of of ideological

874
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,679
brainwashing

875
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,960
this is how at a typical uh

876
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,279
conference in novosti headquarters in

877
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,440

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,600
the sitting in the middle is boris

879
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,640

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,640
ranking party bureaucrat

882
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,960
in the department of propaganda i am

883
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,320
standing next to a

884
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,399
famous indian poet sumitra nandan pant

885
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,360
he was famous because he was an author

886
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,519
he was the author of the famous

887
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,720
poem titled rhapsody to lenin that's why

888
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,120
he was invited to ussr

889
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,679
and everything was paid by the soviet

890
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,039
government

891
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,960
the pay special attention to number of

892
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,279
bottles on the table this is one of the

893
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,720
ways to kill the awareness or

894
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,480
curiosity of foreign journalists

895
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
my one of my functions was to keep

896
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,679
foreign guests

897
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,000
permanently intoxicated the moment they

898
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,919
land at moscow airport

899
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,880
i had to take them to the vip launch and

900
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,720
toast to friendship and understanding

901
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
between the nations of the world

902
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
glass of vodka then the second glass of

903
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,440
vodka and in no time my guests would be

904
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,719
feeling very happy

905
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,320
they would see everything in kind of

906
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,800
pink nice color

907
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,399
and that's the way i i had to keep them

908
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,960
permanently for the next 15 or 20 days

909
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,719
at certain point in time i had to

910
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
withdraw alcohol from them

911
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,480
so that some of them who are the most

912
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,000
recruitable would feel a little bit

913
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,960
shaky

914
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,719
guilty trying to remember what they were

915
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,159
talking last night

916
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,000
that's the time to approach them with

917
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,760
all kind of nonsense such as

918
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,239
joint communicate or statement for for

919
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,239
soviet propaganda

920
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,760
that's the time they are the most

921
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,359
flexible

922
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,560
and of course what they didn't

923
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,639
understand they didn't realize or

924
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,560
pretended not to realize that

925
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,320
myself who was drinking together with

926
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,800
them was not drinking at all

927
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,520
i had ways to get rid of alcohol through

928
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
various techniques including

929
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,680
special pills which were given to me by

930
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,200
my colleagues

931
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,880
but they were taking it seriously in

932
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,640
other words they they would consume

933
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,520
quite a

934
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,720
large volumes of alcohol and feel quite

935
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,839
uneasy next morning

936
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,079
in 1967 the kgb attached me to this

937
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,880
magazine look magazine a group of 12

938
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,440
people

939
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,320
arrived to ussr from united states to

940
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,880
cover

941
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,119
the 50th anniversary of october

942
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,599
socialist revolution in my country

943
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,520
from the first page to the last page it

944
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
was a package of lies

945
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,920
propaganda cliche which were presented

946
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,200
to american

947
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,200
readers as opinions and deductions of

948
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,599
american journalists

949
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,240
nothing could be far from truth this

950
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,040
were not

951
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,760
opinions they were not opinions at all

952
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
they were

953
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,680
the cliches which the soviet propaganda

954
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,240
wants

955
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,079
american public to think that they think

956
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,200
that if it does make any sense at all

957
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,520
it sure does because from the viewpoint

958
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
of the soviet propaganda although there

959
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
are some subtle criticism of the soviet

960
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,000
system

961
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,880
the basic message is that russia today

962
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,040
is a nice functioning

963
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,520
efficient system supported by majority

964
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,640
of population

965
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,960
that's the biggest lie and of course

966
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,720
american intellectuals and journalists

967
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,920
from look magazine

968
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
elaborated on that untruth in various

969
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,280
different ways they intellectualized

970
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
that lie

971
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,920
they found all kinds of justifications

972
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,880
for telling lies to american public

973
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,520
this is excuse me it was partly your job

974
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,839
to make sure that they got these ideas

975
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,000
and accepted them as their own ideas

976
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,200
right actually

977
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,440
even before they arrived to ussr and

978
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
they paid astronomical sum of money for

979
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,800
that visit

980
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,160
uh they were submitted this novice press

981
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,960
agency developed so-called backgrounders

982
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,320
20 25 pages of information and opinions

983
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,400
which were presented to the journalists

984
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
even before they bought their tickets to

985
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,480
moscow they had to analyze this

986
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,640
situation and judging on their reaction

987
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
to that background

988
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,640
the local novice representative or local

989
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,520
soviet

990
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,920
diplomat in washington dc would assess

991
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,560
whether they

992
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,920
have whether they be given visa to ussr

993
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
or not but they were selected oh yes

994
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
they were they were pre-selected

995
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,400
very carefully and there is not much

996
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
chance for honest journalists to arrive

997
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,839
to ussr

998
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,920
and to stay there for one year and to

999
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,119
bring this

1000
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,680
package of lies back home this for

1001
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,160
example

1002
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,240
is a center fold of the tie of the look

1003
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,440
magazine

1004
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
they presented this monument erected by

1005
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
communist party in stalingrad

1006
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
as the symbol personification of russian

1007
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,400
military might

1008
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
and they said in the article which is

1009
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,520
published

1010
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,079
on the side that soviets are very proud

1011
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
of the victory in the second world war

1012
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,599
this is another big myth a lie no

1013
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,680
sensible people would be proud to lose

1014
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,599
20 millions of their countrymen

1015
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,079
in the war which was started by genocide

1016
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:06,880
hitler

1017
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
and comrade stalin and paid by american

1018
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
multinationals

1019
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,480
most of the soviet citizens look at this

1020
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,320
type of monuments with disgust

1021
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,119
and sorrow because every family lost

1022
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,000
father brother

1023
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,480
sister or child in the second world war

1024
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
yet american journalists who were trying

1025
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,079
to

1026
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,280
appease to please their hosts presented

1027
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,359
this picture on the center fold

1028
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,680
as the symbol and personification of

1029
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,440
soviet national

1030
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,640
they call it russian national spirit

1031
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
and it was greatest greatest

1032
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,240
misconception

1033
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,359
and a very tragic misunderstanding

1034
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,720
of course look magazine was not

1035
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,640
distributed in ussr

1036
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,280
the main audience was in the united

1037
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,040
states

1038
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,160
but i presume that many americans

1039
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,079
millions of americans who were reading

1040
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,400
look magazine at that time

1041
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,560
had absolutely wrong idea about the

1042
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,960
sentiments of my nation about what the

1043
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,480
soviets are proud of and what they hate

1044
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
this is a group you see the same lady

1045
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,680
with this ward

1046
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,440
in stalingrad this is the group of

1047
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,359
journalists myself is in the center with

1048
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,119
the same devilish smile

1049
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,280
and mr philip harrington is on the

1050
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,240
extreme left

1051
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,200
there with with his camera this is the

1052
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,000
gentleman

1053
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,839
which was so deaf

1054
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,560
or so uninterested in what i had to say

1055
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
to him

1056
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
this is the same picture a blow up of

1057
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,240
the same the same picture

1058
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,520
many many guests from various countries

1059
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
in this particular case from asia and

1060
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,920
africa were taken by me

1061
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,960
as a novice to press agency employee

1062
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,839
for a tour across siberia for example we

1063
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,720
would show them

1064
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,960
typical kindergarten you see nothing

1065
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,119
special by american standards

1066
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,280
just nice children sitting eating their

1067
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,720
breakfast or or lunch

1068
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,520
what they could not understand or they

1069
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,599
pretended not to understand that this is

1070
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,000
an exemplary kindergarten this is not

1071
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
the kindergarten for average person or

1072
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
average family in ussr

1073
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,960
and we maintain that illusion in their

1074
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,920
minds

1075
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,400
you can see myself under the red spot in

1076
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,720
the middle there with the same

1077
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,599
business-like expression i'm on you know

1078
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
i'm doing my job that that's what i'm

1079
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,960
assigned to do and that's what i was

1080
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,240
paid to do

1081
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
but deep inside i still hope that at

1082
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,760
least some of these

1083
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,240
useful idiots would understand that what

1084
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,160
they are looking at has nothing to do

1085
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,000
with the level of affluence

1086
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,599
in my nation this is a better picture

1087
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
which reflects the true spirit of

1088
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,560
of the soviet uh soviet childhood

1089
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,720
this picture was printed in a canadian

1090
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,240
government publication

1091
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,200
by mistake in the middle you can see

1092
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,560
children playing on a

1093
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,440
small courtyard and the caption goes

1094
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,119
this is a typical kindergarten in

1095
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,560
siberia

1096
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,640
what these idiots didn't understand that

1097
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,400
it is not kindergarten at

1098
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,680
all it is a prison for children of

1099
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,160
political prisoners

1100
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,920
but there was not a single mentioning

1101
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,359
that what they were visiting

1102
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,520
actually was an area of concentration

1103
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
camps

1104
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,359
and the job of people like myself to

1105
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,319
help them

1106
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,200
to not to notice that they are actually

1107
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,040
talking to prisoners

1108
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,480
most of the children were dressed

1109
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,920
especially on the occasion of the

1110
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
foreigners visit

1111
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,319
the of course there were no corpses in

1112
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,520
on the ground

1113
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,040
there were no machine gun guards and the

1114
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,119
well it looks not very pleasant as you

1115
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,000
see it looks dull but obviously it does

1116
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,680
not create an impression that this

1117
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
is actually a prison well did any of the

1118
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,920
journalists have the

1119
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,119
uh curiosity to ask about uh prisons and

1120
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,560
that kind of thing they were in siberia

1121
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,200
this is what you

1122
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,440
saw yes some of them asked questions and

1123
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,119
naturally we would give them the

1124
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,640
for the stupid question we give them

1125
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,800
stupid answer no there are no prisons in

1126
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,839
siberia no

1127
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,560
most of the people who you see are free

1128
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,800
citizens of ussr they are very happy to

1129
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,160
be here

1130
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,720
and they are contributing to the glory

1131
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
of the socialist system

1132
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,599
uh some of them pretended that they they

1133
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,200
believe what what i was

1134
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,119
telling them and um most of them

1135
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,880
we may discuss it later what are the

1136
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,720
motivations of these people

1137
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,800
why would they stubbornly bring lies to

1138
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
their own population

1139
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,640
through their own mass media i have

1140
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
various answers to this there is not a

1141
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,760
single explanation

1142
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,359
it's a complex of explanations it's fear

1143
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,440
pure biological fear they understand

1144
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,200
that they are on the territory of an

1145
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,160
enemy state a police state and just to

1146
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,599
save their rotten skins

1147
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,079
and their miserable jobs their affluence

1148
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,040
back home

1149
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
they would prefer to tell a lie then to

1150
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,079
to ask

1151
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,839
truthful questions and and report

1152
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,160
truthful information

1153
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,040
second most of these schmucks were

1154
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,200
afraid to lose their jobs because

1155
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,960
obviously if you tell truth about my

1156
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,040
country you will not last long as a

1157
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,200
correspondent of new york times

1158
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,160
or los angeles times they will fire you

1159
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,920
what kind of correspondent are you you

1160
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,599
obviously cannot find common language

1161
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,560
with russians

1162
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,680
if they kick you out in 24 hours so

1163
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,240
just by by trying to be conformist to

1164
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
their own editorial bosses

1165
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,040
they tried not to offend the sentiments

1166
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
of the soviet administrators and people

1167
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,240
like myself

1168
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,359
deep inside i hope they would insult my

1169
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,319
uh or offend my sentiments obviously

1170
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,040
they preferred not to

1171
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,319
another reason uh i did i refuse to

1172
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,040
believe it but

1173
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,119
obviously there is another reason

1174
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,079
obviously

1175
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,880
it's agreed these people earn a lot of

1176
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,280
money

1177
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,079
when they come back to usa they claim

1178
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,319
that they are experts in my country

1179
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,319
they write books which sells in million

1180
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,040
copies titled like russians the truth

1181
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,160
about russia

1182
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,960
most of it is lie about russia yet they

1183
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,920
claim to be sovietologists

1184
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,079
they they break they play back myth

1185
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,200
about my country

1186
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,079
the propaganda cliches yet they are

1187
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,680
stubbornly resist

1188
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,839
the word of truth if a person like

1189
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,200
solzhenitsyn is either defecting or

1190
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,800
kicked out of ussr

1191
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,280
they try all their best to dis to

1192
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,079
discredit him and to discourage him

1193
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,920
i don't have much chance to appear on

1194
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,200
national network

1195
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,920
uh with the true story about my country

1196
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,400
but a useful edit like hendrick smith or

1197
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,680
robert kaiser

1198
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,599
they are big heroes they come back from

1199
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,920
ussr they say oh we were talking to

1200
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,599
dissidents in russia

1201
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,720
big deal soviet distances are chasing

1202
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,000
american correspondents

1203
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,079
in the streets and they are cowardly

1204
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,720
escaping from these contacts

1205
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,400
for some strange reason if you want to

1206
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,760
know more about spain

1207
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,319
you refer to spanish writers if you want

1208
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,000
to learn more about french

1209
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,119
you read french or writers

1210
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,040
even about antarctica i bet you would

1211
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,319
read penguins

1212
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,480
only about the soviet union for some

1213
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,440
strange reason

1214
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,280
you read hendricks and schmendricks and

1215
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
all kind of kissingers

1216
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,520
because they claim that they know more

1217
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,040
about my country they know

1218
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,280
nothing or next to nothing or they

1219
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,480
pretend that they know

1220
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,839
more than they actually do i would say

1221
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,119
they are dishonest

1222
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,480
people who lack integrity and

1223
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,280
common sense and intellectual honesty

1224
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,240
they bring back

1225
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
all kind of stories like that a

1226
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,720
kindergarten in siberia

1227
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,359
a meeting the most important fact it's a

1228
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,240
prison

1229
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,119
for children of political prisoners

1230
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,079
another greatest example of monumental

1231
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,119
idiocy

1232
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,560
of american politicians edward kennedy

1233
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
was in moscow

1234
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,040
and he thought that he is a popular

1235
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,079
charismatic

1236
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,200
american politician who is easy going

1237
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,240
who can smile

1238
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,480
dance at the wedding in in russian

1239
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,160
palace of marriages

1240
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
what he does what he did not understand

1241
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,319
or maybe he pretended not to understand

1242
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,000
that actually he was being taken

1243
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,119
for a ride this is a staged bedding

1244
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,240
especially to impress

1245
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,599
foreign media or or useful idiots like

1246
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,280
ed kennedy

1247
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,560
most of the of the guests there they had

1248
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,079
security clearance

1249
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,079
and they were instructed what to say to

1250
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,839
foreigners

1251
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,680
this is exactly what i was doing you can

1252
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,599
see me in the same damn

1253
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,319
bedding palace in moscow where ed

1254
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,839
kennedy was dancing here

1255
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,400
you see smiling he thinks he is very

1256
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,119
smart

1257
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,960
from the viewpoint of russian citizens

1258
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,800
who observe this idiocy

1259
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,880
he is he's narrow-minded

1260
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,119
egocentrical idiot who tries to earn his

1261
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,880
own popularity through the

1262
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
uh through participation in propaganda

1263
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,079
forces like this

1264
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,800
here you can see myself on the right

1265
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,280
again

1266
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,960
exemplary soviet bride on the left three

1267
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,200
journalists from various countries asia

1268
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,960
africa and latin america

1269
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,079
obviously they enjoying the situation

1270
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,000
they they will go back home and write

1271
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,400
the reports we were present and

1272
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,880
on the regular soviet wedding they were

1273
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,200
not present on the regular soviet

1274
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,960
they were present they were part of a

1275
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,119
farce of a circus performance

1276
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,480
another thing which i had to

1277
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,720
sometimes risking my life to explain to

1278
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,839
foreigners

1279
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,480
time magazine for example is very

1280
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,359
critical of

1281
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,400
south african racist regime

1282
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,839
the whole article was dedicated to the

1283
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,640
shameful internal passport system where

1284
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,280
black

1285
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,520
blacks are not allowing to live with

1286
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,640
whites

1287
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,559
for some strange reason for the last 14

1288
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,559
years since my defection nobody wanted

1289
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,800
to pay attention to my passport

1290
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,280
this is my passport it also shows my

1291
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,480
nationality

1292
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,040
and it it has a police rubber stamp

1293
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,640
which is called prapiska

1294
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,200
in russian language which assigns me to

1295
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,240
a certain

1296
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,880
area of residence i cannot leave that

1297
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,599
area

1298
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,680
same way as this black man cannot leave

1299
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,640
the area

1300
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,280
in south africa yet we call south

1301
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,079
african government racist regime

1302
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,319
not a single jane jane schmonder or

1303
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,359
fonda is

1304
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,520
brave enough courageous enough to come

1305
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,640
to media and say

1306
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,760
look this is what happens in ussr i send

1307
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
a copy of my passport to many

1308
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,040
american liberals and civil rights uh

1309
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,839
defenders

1310
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,920
and all the other useful idiots they

1311
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,000
never they never bothered to answer me

1312
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,800
back

1313
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,720
this shows what kind of integrity what

1314
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,200
kind of honesty these people are

1315
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,119
they're a bunch of hypocrites because

1316
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,880
they don't want to recognize

1317
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,000
a good example of racism in my country

1318
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,240
this is the first stage of befriending a

1319
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,400
professor you can see myself on the left

1320
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,079
with the same james bond

1321
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,640
smile on my on the right is my kgb

1322
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,200

political science in delhi university

1325
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
the next stage would be to invite him to

1326
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,440
a gathering of in the soviet friendship

1327
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,520
society there he is sitting next to his

1328
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,400
wife

1329
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,359
before he is being sent to ussr for free

1330
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,160
trip

1331
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,599
everything is paid by the soviet

1332
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,160
government he was made to believe that

1333
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,400
he is invited to ussr because he is a

1334
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,280
talented

1335
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,800
sober thinking intellectual

1336
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,880
absolutely false he is invited because

1337
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,319
he is a useful idiot

1338
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,880
because he would agree and subscribe to

1339
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,280
most of the soviet propaganda cliche

1340
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,520
and when he is coming back to his own

1341
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,240
country he is going for years and years

1342
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,920
to teach the beauties of soviet

1343
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,079
socialism to

1344
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,000
newer and newer generations of his

1345
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
students thus promoting the soviet

1346
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,359
propaganda line

1347
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,400
the kgb was even curious about

1348
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,960
this gentleman it may look innocent

1349
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,559
maharishi mahesh yogi

1350
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,200
a great spiritual leader or maybe a

1351
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,359
great charlatan and crook

1352
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,040
depending on which from which side you

1353
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,880
are looking at him

1354
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,440
beetles were trained at his ashram in

1355
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,240
hardware in

1356
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,200
india how to meditate mia faro and and

1357
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,920
other

1358
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,720
uh useful idiots from hollywood visited

1359
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,119
his

1360
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,000
uh school and they returned back to

1361
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,160
united states absolutely zonked out of

1362
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,760
their minds with marijuana

1363
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,880
hashish and crazy ideas of meditation

1364
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,440
to meditate in other words to isolate

1365
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,160
oneself

1366
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,880
from the current social and political

1367
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,119
issues of your own country

1368
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,040
to get into your own bubble to forget

1369
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,200
about troubles of the world

1370
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,520
obviously kgb was very fascinated with

1371
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,359
such a beautiful school

1372
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,240
such a brainwashing center for stupid

1373
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,040
americans

1374
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,200
i was dispatched by the kgb to check

1375
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
what kind of vip

1376
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
americans attend this school that's you

1377
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
on the left yes i'm on the left

1378
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,760
i i i was trying to get enrolled in that

1379
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,119
school unfortunately

1380
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,280
maharishi mahashiyogi asked too much he

1381
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,440
wanted 500 american dollars for

1382
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,720
enrollment

1383
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,880
but my function was not actually to get

1384
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
enrolled in the school my function was

1385
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,280
to discover

1386
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,160
what kind of people from united states

1387
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:16,720
attend

1388
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,520
this school and we discovered that yes

1389
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,839
there are some

1390
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,960
influential members of family

1391
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,800
public opinion makers of united states

1392
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
who come back with the crazy stories

1393
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,200
about indian philosophy

1394
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,680
indians themselves look up upon them as

1395
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,400
idiots

1396
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,520
useful idiots to say nothing about kgb

1397
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,800
who looked at them as as

1398
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,760
as extremely naive misguided people

1399
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,960
obviously a vip say a wife of

1400
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,000
of a congressman or or a prominent

1401
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,680
hollywood personality

1402
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,760
after the after being trained in that

1403
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,520
school is much more

1404
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,200
instrumental in the hands of of

1405
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,200
manipulators of public opinion

1406
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,480
and kgb than a normal person who who

1407
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,400
understands who who looks through this

1408
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,839
this this this type of

1409
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,559
fake religious training why would they

1410
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,559
be more susceptible to manipulation

1411
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,800
i just mentioned that because you see a

1412
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,160
a person

1413
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,359
who is too much involved in in

1414
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,079
in introspective meditation you see if

1415
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,000
you carefully look what what maharishi

1416
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,680
mahashiyogi is teaching to

1417
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,720
to americans is that all most of the

1418
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,280
problems

1419
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,839
most of the burning issues of today can

1420
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,640
be solved simply by meditating

1421
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,280
don't don't don't rock the boat don't

1422
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,480
get involved

1423
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,240
just sit down look at your navel and

1424
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,079
meditate and the things

1425
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,720
due to some strange logic due to cosmic

1426
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,920
vibration will will

1427
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,200
will settle down by themselves this is

1428
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
exactly what the kgb and marxist

1429
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,440
leninist propaganda wants from americans

1430
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,960
to destruct their opinion uh attention

1431
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,520
and

1432
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,240
mental energy from real issues of united

1433
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,800
states

1434
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,520
into a non-issues into a non-world

1435
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,960
non-existent

1436
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,839
harmony obviously it's more beneficial

1437
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,359
for the soviet aggressors

1438
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,079
to have a bunch of duped americans than

1439
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,240
americans who are self-conscious

1440
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,000
healthy physically fit and alert

1441
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,960
to the reality maharishi mahesh yogi

1442
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,480
obviously is not on the payroll of the

1443
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,319
kgb

1444
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,400
but whether he knows it or not he

1445
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,720
contributes greatly to demoralization of

1446
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,319
american society

1447
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,319
and he is not the only one there are

1448
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,079
hundreds of those gurus

1449
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,839
who come to you to your country to

1450
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,920
capitalize on naivete

1451
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,640
and stupidity of americans it's a

1452
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,440
fashion

1453
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,119
it's a fashion to meditate it's a

1454
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,400
fashion not to be involved

1455
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,760
so obviously you can see that if if kgb

1456
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,880
were

1457
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,720
that curious if they paid my trip to

1458
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,200
hardware if they assigned me to that to

1459
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,160
that strange

1460
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,480
job obviously they were very much

1461
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,760
fascinated

1462
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,160
they were convinced that that type of of

1463
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,000
brainwashing is very efficient

1464
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,319
and instrumental in demoralization of

1465
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,440
united states

1466
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,839
our conversation with yuri alexandrovich

1467
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:12,960
besmienov

1468
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,960
who is a defector from the soviet union

1469
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,880
a former propaganda agent

1470
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,400
for navasti and the kgb will continue

1471
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,839
after this message

1472
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:39,880
[Music]

1473
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,240
[Music]

1474
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,000
this picture shows the part of the

1475
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,280
building of ussr

1476
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,839
embassy and my supervisors on the left

1477
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,119
is comrade mehdi

1478
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,280
an indian communist and on the right

1479
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,880
komrad mit rohin

1480
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,040
my supervisors in the secret department

1481
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,760
of research and country propaganda

1482
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,040
it has nothing to do with either

1483
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,280
research or country propaganda

1484
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,440
most of the activity of the department

1485
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,680
was to compile huge

1486
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,640
amount volume of information on

1487
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,799
individuals who were instrumental in

1488
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,960
creating public opinion

1489
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,079
publishers editors journalists

1490
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,280
actors educationalists professors of

1491
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,480
political science

1492
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,839
members of parliament uh representatives

1493
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,000
of business circles

1494
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,680
most of these people were divided

1495
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,040
roughly into groups

1496
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,799
those who would tow the soviet foreign

1497
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,720
policy they would be promoted to the

1498
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,160
positions of power

1499
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,680
through media and public opinion

1500
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,760
manipulation those who refused the

1501
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
soviet influence in their own country

1502
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,119
would be character assassinated or

1503
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,720
executed physically come revolution

1504
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,760
same way as in the small town of huwa in

1505
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,880
south vietnam

1506
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,720
several thousands of vietnamese were

1507
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,640
executed in one night

1508
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,960
when the city was captured by viet cong

1509
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,559
for only two days

1510
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,960
an american cia could never figure out

1511
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
how could possibly communists

1512
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,040
know each individual where he leaves

1513
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,720
where where to get him

1514
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,280
and would be arrested in one night

1515
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,000
basically

1516
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,640
in some four hours before dawn put on a

1517
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,520
van

1518
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,160
taken out of the city limits and shot

1519
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,599
the answer is very simple

1520
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,920
long before communists occupied the city

1521
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,000
there was extensive network of

1522
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,280
informers local vietnamese citizens

1523
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,520
who knew absolutely everything about

1524
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,359
people who are instrumental in public

1525
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,079
opinion

1526
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,799
including barbers and taxi drivers

1527
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,559
everyone who was sympathetic to united

1528
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,240
states was executed

1529
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,799
same thing was done under the guidance

1530
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,960
of of the soviet embassy in hanoi and

1531
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,040
same thing i was doing in new delhi

1532
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,960
to my horror i discovered that in the

1533
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,880
files where people were doomed

1534
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,839
to execution there were names of

1535
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,920
pro-soviet journalists with whom

1536
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,520
i was personally friendly yes

1537
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,240
they were idealistically minded leftists

1538
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,880
who

1539
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,000
made several visits to ussr and yet the

1540
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,400
kgb decided that com revolution or

1541
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,799
drastic changes in political structure

1542
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,359
of india they will have to go why is

1543
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,000
that

1544
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,280
because they know too much simply

1545
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,440
because you see the useful idiots the

1546
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,559
the leftists who are

1547
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,880
idealistically believing in the beauty

1548
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,640
of soviet socialist or communist or

1549
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,559
whatever system

1550
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,400
when they get disillusioned they become

1551
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,599
the worst enemies

1552
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,680
that's why my kgb instructors

1553
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,359
specifically made the point

1554
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,319
never bother with leftists forget about

1555
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,079
these political prostitutes

1556
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,200
aim higher this was my instruction

1557
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,280
try to get into into a large circulation

1558
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,559
established conservative media reach

1559
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,599
filthy reach movie makers intellectuals

1560
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,599
so-called academic circles

1561
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,839
cynical egocentric people who can look

1562
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,920
into your eyes with angelic expression

1563
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,599
and tell you a lie

1564
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,520
this are the most recruitable people

1565
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,760
people who lack moral principles

1566
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,799
who are either too greedy or to

1567
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,680
suffer from self-importance they feel

1568
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,319
that

1569
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,760
they they matter a lot these are the

1570
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,400
people who

1571
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,680
kgb wanted very much to recruit but to

1572
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,520
eliminate the others to execute the

1573
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:17,920
others

1574
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,359
don't they serve some purpose wouldn't

1575
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,040
they be the ones that realize they serve

1576
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,760
purpose only at the stage of

1577
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,280
destabilization of a nation for example

1578
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,000
your leftists in the united states all

1579
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,920
these professors and all these

1580
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,720
beautiful civil rights defenders they

1581
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,799
are instrumental in the process of the

1582
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,319
of the uh

1583
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,880
subversion only to destabilize the

1584
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,319
nation

1585
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,720
when their job is completed they're not

1586
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,160
they're not needed anymore

1587
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,960
they know too much some of them when

1588
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,720
when they get disillusioned when they

1589
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,119
see that marxist lenin has come to power

1590
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,200
obviously they get offended they think

1591
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,880
that they will come to power

1592
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,480
that will never happen of course they

1593
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,079
will be lined up against the wall and

1594
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:58,960
shot

1595
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,520
but they may turn into the most bitter

1596
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,400
enemies

1597
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,240
of marxist leninist when they come to

1598
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,599
power and that's what happened in

1599
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,079
nicaragua you remember most of these

1600
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,480
former marxist leninists were either put

1601
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,359
to prison

1602
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,200
or one of them split and now he's

1603
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,040
working against sandinistas

1604
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,599
it happened in grenada when maurice

1605
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,079
bishop

1606
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,640
was he was already a marxist he was

1607
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,880
executed by by a new marxist who was

1608
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,720
more marxist than this marxist

1609
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,880
same happened in afghanistan when uh

1610
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,720
first there was taraki he was killed by

1611
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,480
amin and amin was killed by

1612
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,720
karmal with the help of kgb same

1613
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,799
happened in in bangladesh when mujibur

1614
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,280
rahman very pro-soviet leftist

1615
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,520
was assassinated by his own

1616
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,799
marxist-leninist

1617
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,599
military comrades it's the same pattern

1618
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,400
everywhere

1619
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,559
the moment they serve their purpose all

1620
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,480
the useful idiots are used

1621
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,119
either be executed entirely all the

1622
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,200
idealistically minded marxists

1623
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,160
or were exiled or put in prisons like in

1624
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,079
cuba many many former marxists are in

1625
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,799
cuba

1626
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,240
i mean in prison so most of the indians

1627
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,319
who were cooperating with the soviets

1628
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,920
especially without the department of

1629
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,640
of uh information of the ussr embassy

1630
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,040
were

1631
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,160
listed for execution

1632
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,319
and when i discovered that fact of

1633
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,319
course i was sick i was mentally and

1634
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,400
physically sick i thought that i'm going

1635
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,000
to explode one day

1636
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,760
during the briefing of the ambassador's

1637
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,200
office i would stand up and say

1638
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:25,920
something that

1639
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,160
we are basically a bunch of murderers

1640
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,440
that's what we are we

1641
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,520
it has nothing to do with friendship and

1642
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,119
understanding between the nation and

1643
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,319
blah blah blah

1644
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,960
we are murderers we behave as a bunch of

1645
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,440
thugs

1646
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,799
in in a country which which is

1647
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,280
hospitable to us a country which

1648
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,880
with ancient traditions but i i did not

1649
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,200
defect i tried to get the message across

1650
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,680
to my

1651
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
horror nobody wanted even to listen

1652
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,079
least of all to believe what i had to

1653
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,280
say

1654
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,520
and i tried all kind of tricks i would i

1655
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,799
would i would

1656
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:00,160
leak information through letters uh or

1657
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,079
lost documents or something like that

1658
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,680
and still i got no message

1659
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,760
the message was not published even in

1660
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
the conservative mass media of

1661
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,799
india the immediate impulse to defect

1662
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,559
was bangladesh crisis which was

1663
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,359
described by american correspondents

1664
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,079
as islamic grassroots revolution which

1665
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:18,400
is

1666
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,520
absolute baloney there was nothing to do

1667
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,240
with islam

1668
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,079
and there was no grassroots revolution

1669
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,280
actually there are no grassroots

1670
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,640
revolutions period

1671
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,559
any revolution is a byproduct of a

1672
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,040
highly organized group

1673
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,839
of conscientious and professional

1674
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:34,720
organizers

1675
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,440
but has nothing to do with grassroots in

1676
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,559
bangladesh

1677
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,280
it was nothing with grassroots most of

1678
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:41,839
the

1679
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,720
avami league party members of amilign's

1680
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,280
people's

1681
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,319
party were trained in moscow in the high

1682
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:49,599
party school

1683
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,520
most of the mukti fault leaders

1684
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,760
muktifajis in bengali means people's

1685
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,400
army

1686
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,480
same as swappo and and all kind of

1687
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,559
liberation armies all over the world

1688
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,039
the same bunch of useful idiots they

1689
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,119
were trained at lumumba university and

1690
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,079
various centers of the kgb in sinfiropol

1691
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,319
in

1692
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,440
in crimea and in tashkent

1693
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,160
so when i saw that india indian

1694
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,079
territory is being used as a as a

1695
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,039
jumping board

1696
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,240
to destroy east pakistan i saw myself

1697
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,280
thousands of of so-called students

1698
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,760
traveling through india to east pakistan

1699
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,720
through the territory

1700
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,520
of india and indian government pretended

1701
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,280
not to see what was going on

1702
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,720
they knew perfectly well the indian

1703
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,559
police knew it the intelligence

1704
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,000
department of indian government

1705
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,079
knew it the kgb of course knew it and

1706
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,839
the cia knew it

1707
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,920
that that was most infuriating because

1708
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,760
when i defected and i explained to the

1709
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,280
cia debriefers

1710
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,720
they should watch out because east

1711
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,039
pakistan is going to erupt any moment

1712
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,680
they said i i was i was reading to too

1713
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,920
many james bond novels

1714
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,359
anyway so east pakistan was doomed

1715
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,160
uh one of my colleagues in in the soviet

1716
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,079
consulate in kolkata when he was dead

1717
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,000
drunk he ventured into the basement

1718
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,880
to relieve himself and he founded big

1719
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,920
boxes

1720
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,920
which said printed matter to dhaka

1721
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,440
university

1722
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,319
dhaka is the capital of his pakistan and

1723
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,480
since he was drunk and curious he opened

1724
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,480
one of the boxes and he discovered not

1725
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,640
printed matter he discovered kalashnikov

1726
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,640
guns and ammunition in there

1727
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,119
anyway it's a long story when i saw the

1728
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,319
preparations for the

1729
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,960
for the uh invasion into east pakistan

1730
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,839
obviously i wanted to defect immediately

1731
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,359
the only thing i couldn't

1732
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,160
i couldn't at that time make up my mind

1733
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:34,559
when

1734
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,440
and where and how one of the reasons of

1735
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,160
course you see

1736
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,799
i was in love with india i mentioned it

1737
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,599
before

1738
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,240
i spoke the languages i socialized with

1739
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,039
people

1740
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,760
and i understood that i had to to act

1741
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,559
fast

1742
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,640
unless i want this beautiful country to

1743
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,480
be permanently and

1744
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,160
irreparably damaged by our presence

1745
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,720
one of the reasons not to defect was as

1746
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,640
you can see i was living in relative

1747
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,760
affluence

1748
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,799
who the hell in in the normal mind

1749
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,359
would defect and do what to be abused by

1750
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:08,319
your media

1751
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,839
to be called mccarthyist and fascist and

1752
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,559
paranoid

1753
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,960
or to drive a taxi in new york city what

1754
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,280
for what the hell for should i defect

1755
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,720
to be abused by americans to be insulted

1756
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,799
in exchange for my effort to bring the

1757
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,240
truthful information about

1758
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,799
impending danger of subversion as you

1759
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,240
can see i was living

1760
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,319
in quite a comfortable conditions next

1761
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:31,440
to swimming pool where

1762
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,680
indians were not allowed by the way i

1763
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,920
was highly paid expert in propaganda

1764
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,240
i had my family i was respected by my

1765
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,680
nation

1766
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,720
my career was cloudless the third reason

1767
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,760
how to defect with the family

1768
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,440
to defect with the baby and the wife

1769
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,079
would be virtual suicide because

1770
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,480
according to law that hypocritical law

1771
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,160
which i quoted before

1772
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,760
the indian police will have to hand me

1773
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,200
over back to the kgb

1774
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,039
and that will be the end of my defection

1775
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,200
and probably my life

1776
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,319
again i cannot smuggle my wife

1777
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,559
because she was not quite sure what what

1778
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,640
i was doing she was not that

1779
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,559
idealistically involved and she was

1780
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,079
definitely not in in the total picture

1781
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,079
of what i was doing for the kgb

1782
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,280
she would be shocked if i if i

1783
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,920
you know put her in my van and drive her

1784
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,559
to american embassy or elsewhere

1785
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,839
that would be a greatest danger so

1786
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,839
again i had to defect in such a way that

1787
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,039
my defection would look

1788
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,280
as simple disappearance and there were

1789
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,720
many cases like that

1790
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,240
when the soviet agents simply

1791
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,880
disappeared either killed in action

1792
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,079
or thanks to their curiosity and and

1793
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,240
their close contacts with radicals some

1794
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,079
of them were killed by the marxist by

1795
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,119
the way

1796
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,039
it happened in many african countries

1797
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,039
when the soviet kgb were killed by

1798
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,280
africans themselves not because they

1799
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,200
hated marxism leninist but because they

1800
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,039
were simply trigger happy

1801
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,880
bunch of unruly characters if you give

1802
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,520
them machine gun they will shoot

1803
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,119
and some of the soviets obviously were

1804
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,599
not careful enough to protect themselves

1805
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:06,960
and they got into embarrassing

1806
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,200
situations when they were shot

1807
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,599
at the crossfire between factions of

1808
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,319
so-called liberation movements

1809
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,039
anyway so i i decided as i said to study

1810
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:17,760
the

1811
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,000
counter culture i decided this probably

1812
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,720
would be the best way to disappear

1813
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,440
i socialize with characters like this on

1814
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,079
the left

1815
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,480
you see he's a barefoot american hippie

1816
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,960
it took me quite a long time to study

1817
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,039
exactly what they were doing and how to

1818
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,319
mix with them

1819
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,319
but eventually i did it most of indian

1820
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,240
newspapers carried my picture

1821
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
and promise of 2 000 rupees for

1822
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,280
information

1823
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,839
about my whereabouts but they were

1824
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,520
looking for wrong person because they

1825
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,720
obviously tried to stop a young soviet

1826
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,599
diplomat

1827
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,480
in white shirt and thai and this is how

1828
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,480
i looked at the time of defection nobody

1829
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,000
could possibly

1830
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,680
think that the soviet diplomat would be

1831
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,160
as crazy as to join a bunch of hippies

1832
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,039
that's you yes travel indian smokehouse

1833
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:05,359
so

1834
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,039
i made it literally almost like a

1835
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,920
hollywood style

1836
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,799
detective story uh from under the nose

1837
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,280
of the kgb in bombay airport

1838
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,680
i landed the plane and i flew to to

1839
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,480
greece where i was debriefed by the cia

1840
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,960
that's basically the most that's all for

1841
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,839
my

1842
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,599
slides we can turn off the projectors

1843
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,839
and that's very interesting

1844
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,000
well you spoke several times before

1845
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,240
about ideological subversion that is a

1846
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,599
phrase that

1847
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,280
i'm afraid some americans don't fully

1848
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,440
understand when

1849
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,000
the soviets use the phrase ideological

1850
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
subversion what do they mean by it

1851
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,160
ideological subversion is is the process

1852
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,599
which is legitimate overt

1853
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,760
and open you can see it with your own

1854
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,160
eyes all you have to do all american

1855
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,160
mass media has to do is to unplug their

1856
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,920
bananas from their ears

1857
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,240
open up their eyes and they can see it

1858
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,319
there's no mystery there's nothing to do

1859
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,599
with espionage

1860
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,359
i know that espionage intelligence

1861
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,119
gathering looks more romantic

1862
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,440
it sells more deodorants through the

1863
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,520
advertising probably that's why

1864
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,599
your hollywood producers are so crazy

1865
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,120
about james bond

1866
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,040
type of thrillers but in reality

1867
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,679
the main emphasis of the kgb is not in

1868
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,799
the area of its

1869
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,238
intelligence at all according to my

1870
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,238
opinion and opinion of many defectors of

1871
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,359
my caliber

1872
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,479
only about 15 of time money and

1873
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,920
manpower is spent on espionage as such

1874
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,600
the other 85 percent

1875
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,040
is a slow process which we call either

1876
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,839
ideological subversion or active

1877
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:46,839
measures

1878
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:49,759
activeness in the language of the kgb

1879
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,000
or psychological warfare what it

1880
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,359
basically means is

1881
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,319
to change the perception of reality of

1882
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,198
every

1883
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,799
american to such an extent that despite

1884
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,439
of the abundance of information

1885
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,759
no one is able to come to sensible

1886
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,279
conclusions

1887
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,839
in the interests of defending themselves

1888
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:10,719
their families

1889
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,000
their community and their country it's a

1890
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,759
great brainwashing process which goes

1891
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,560
very slow and is divided in four basic

1892
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,560
stages

1893
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,279
uh the first one being demoralization it

1894
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,759
takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize

1895
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:28,640
a nation

1896
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,600
why that many years because this is the

1897
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,520
minimum number of years which requires

1898
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,479
to

1899
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,600
educate one generation of students

1900
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,640
in the country of of of your enemy

1901
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,920
exposed to the ideology of the enemy

1902
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,640
in other words marxism leninism ideology

1903
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,880
is being pumped into the soft heads of

1904
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,399
of at least three generations of

1905
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,319
american students without being

1906
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,238
challenged or counterbalanced by the

1907
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,360
basic values

1908
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,320
of americanism american patriotism the

1909
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,280
result

1910
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,280
the result you can see most of the

1911
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,760
people who graduated in 60s

1912
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,560
dropouts or half-baked intellectuals are

1913
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,800
now occupying the positions of power in

1914
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,440
the government

1915
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,000
civil service business mass media

1916
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,440
educational system

1917
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,520
you are stuck with them you cannot get

1918
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,760
rid of them they are contaminated they

1919
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,159
are

1920
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,400
programmed to think and react to certain

1921
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,199
stimuli

1922
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,760
in a certain pattern you cannot change

1923
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,840
their mind even if you if you

1924
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,400
expose them to authentic information

1925
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,400
even if you prove that white is white

1926
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,360
and black

1927
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,440
is black you still cannot change the

1928
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,400
basic

1929
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,440
perception and the logic of behavior

1930
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,040
in other words these people the process

1931
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,159
of demoralization

1932
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,040
is complete and irreversible to get rid

1933
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,640
society of these people you have you

1934
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,360
need

1935
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,480
another 20 or or 15 years

1936
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,480
to educate a new generation of

1937
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,080
patriotically minded

1938
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,440
and and common common sense

1939
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,960
people who would be acting in

1940
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,159
favor and in the interests of of the of

1941
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,400
united states society and yet these

1942
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,159
people have been programmed and as you

1943
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,120
say in place

1944
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,920
and who are favorable to an opening with

1945
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,360
the soviet concept

1946
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,800
these are the very people who would be

1947
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,719
marked for extermination in this country

1948
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,400
most of them yes

1949
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,159
simply because the psychological shock

1950
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,560
when they will see in future what the

1951
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,520
what the beautiful

1952
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,920
society of equality and social justice

1953
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,679
means in practice

1954
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,000
obviously they will revolt they they

1955
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,120
will

1956
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,199
they will be very unhappy frustrated

1957
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,239
people

1958
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,800
and the marxist leninist regime does not

1959
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,199
tolerate these people

1960
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,120
they obviously they will join the links

1961
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,560
of the centers

1962
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,320
dissidents uh unlike in present

1963
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
united states there will be no place for

1964
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,840
descent in future marxist leninist

1965
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,360
america here you can you can get

1966
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,239
popular like daniel ellsberg and filthy

1967
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,920
rich like jane fonda

1968
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,000
for being dissident for criticizing your

1969
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,960
pentagon

1970
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,760
in future these people will be simply

1971
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,440
squashed like cockroaches

1972
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,199
nobody is going to pay them nothing for

1973
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,560
their beautiful noble ideas of equality

1974
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,719
this they don't understand and it will

1975
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,360
be greatest shock for them of course

1976
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,760
the demoralization process in the united

1977
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,719
states is basically completed already

1978
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,080
uh for the last 25 years actually it's

1979
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,679
over fulfilled because

1980
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,400
demoralization now reaches such areas

1981
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,520
where previously

1982
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,960
not even comrade and drop off

1983
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,760
would even dream of such a tremendous

1984
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,040
success

1985
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,360
most of it is done by americans to

1986
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,480
americans

1987
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,560
thanks to lack of moral standards as i

1988
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,080
mentioned before

1989
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,360
uh exposure to true information does not

1990
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,280
matter anymore

1991
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,640
a person who was demoralized is unable

1992
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,440
to assess

1993
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,480
true information the facts tell nothing

1994
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,600
to him

1995
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,159
uh even if i shower him with information

1996
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:04,719
with

1997
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,719
authentic proof with documents with

1998
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,239
pictures

1999
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,320
even if i take him by force to the

2000
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,400
soviet union and show him concentration

2001
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,040
camp

2002
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,159
he will refuse to believe it until

2003
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,719
he is going to receive a kick in the in

2004
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,239
his fat bottom

2005
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,120
when the military boot crashes his then

2006
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,239
he will understand

2007
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,080
but not before that that's the tragic of

2008
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,320
the situation of demoralization

2009
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,880
so basically america is stuck with

2010
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,239
demoralization and

2011
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,800
unless even if if you start right now

2012
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,880
here this minute you start educating new

2013
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,080
generation of americans

2014
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,880
it will still take you 15 to 20 years to

2015
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,400
turn the tide

2016
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,080
of ideological perception of reality

2017
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,440
uh back to normal normalcy and

2018
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,199
patriotism the next stage is

2019
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,760
destabilization

2020
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,640
this time subverter does not care about

2021
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,480
your ideas and the patterns of your

2022
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,360
consumption

2023
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,199
whether you eat junk food and get fat

2024
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,360
and flop it doesn't matter anymore

2025
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,600
this time and it takes only from two to

2026
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,239
five years to destabilize the nation

2027
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,520
uh it's what what matters is essentials

2028
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,000
economy foreign relations defense

2029
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,080
systems

2030
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,400
and you can see it quite clearly that in

2031
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,239
some areas

2032
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:24,000
in such sensitive areas as defense

2033
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,520
and economy the influence of marxist

2034
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,000
leninist

2035
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,480
ideas in the united states is absolutely

2036
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,880
fantastic i could never believe it 14

2037
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,800
years ago when i landed

2038
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,800
in this part of the world that the

2039
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,760
process will go that fast

2040
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,159
the next stage of course is crisis it

2041
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,199
may take only

2042
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,520
up to six weeks to to bring a country to

2043
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,719
the verge of crisis

2044
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,440
you can see it in in central america now

2045
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,800
and after crisis

2046
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,120
with a violent change of of power

2047
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,640
structure and economy

2048
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,560
you have so-called the period of

2049
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,520
normalization it may last indefinitely

2050
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,840
normalization is a cynical expression

2051
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,600
borrowed from soviet propaganda

2052
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,120
when the soviet tanks moved into

2053
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,040
czechoslovakia in 68

2054
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,679
comrade brezhnev said now the situation

2055
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,679
in brotherly czechoslovakia is

2056
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,040
normalized

2057
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,640
this is what will happen in the united

2058
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,719
states if you allow all the schmucks to

2059
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,280
bring the country to crisis

2060
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,600
to promise people all kind of goodies

2061
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,760
and the paradise on earth

2062
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,040
to to destabilize your economy

2063
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,960
to eliminate the principle of free

2064
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,320
market competition

2065
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,440
and to put a big brother government

2066
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,880
in washington dc with the benevolent

2067
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,360
dictators like walter mondale

2068
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,679
who will promise lots of things never

2069
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:42,960
mind whether the promises are

2070
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
fulfillable or not

2071
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,640
he will go to moscow to kiss the bottoms

2072
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,679
of new

2073
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,159
generation of soviet assassins never

2074
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,600
mind he will create

2075
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,320
false illusions that the situation is

2076
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,400
under control situation is not

2077
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,960
under control situation is disgustingly

2078
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,400
out of control

2079
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,960
most of the american politicians media

2080
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,040
and educational system

2081
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,520
trains another generation of people who

2082
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,320
think they

2083
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,239
are living at the peace time false

2084
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,960
united states is in the state of war

2085
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:15,840
undeclared

2086
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,520
total war against the basic principles

2087
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,640
and the foundations of this system

2088
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,280
and and the initiator of this war is not

2089
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,000
covered on drop off of course

2090
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,440
uh it's it's the system however

2091
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,880
ridiculous it may sound

2092
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,360
the world communist system or the world

2093
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,360
communist conspiracy whether i scare

2094
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,400
some people or not

2095
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,120
i don't give a hoot if if you are not

2096
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,480
scared by now

2097
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,520
nothing can scare you but you don't have

2098
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,120
to be paranoid about it

2099
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,320
what what actually happens now that

2100
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,679
unlike myself

2101
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,840
you have literally several years to live

2102
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,400
on unless united states wake up

2103
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,840
the the time bomb is ticking with every

2104
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,679
second the disaster is coming closer and

2105
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:04,400
closer

2106
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,040
unlike myself you will have nowhere to

2107
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,960
defect to

2108
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,640
unless you want to live in antarctica

2109
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,880
with penguins this is it this is the

2110
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,719
last country of freedom

2111
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,760
and possibility okay so what do we do

2112
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,360
what is your recommendation to the

2113
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,120
american people well

2114
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,560
uh the the uh the immediate thing that

2115
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,600
comes to my mind

2116
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,440
is of course there must be a very strong

2117
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,280
national effort to educate people in in

2118
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,440
in the spirit of real patriotism number

2119
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,640
one number two

2120
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,360
to to explain them the real danger of

2121
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,600
socialist communist whatever welfare

2122
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,239
state

2123
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,040
big brother government if people will

2124
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,560
fail to grasp the

2125
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,000
impending danger of that development

2126
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,239
nothing ever can help united states you

2127
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,920
may kiss goodbye to your freedom

2128
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,120
including freedoms to homosexuals to

2129
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,760
a prison inmate all this freedom will

2130
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,320
vanish evaporating in five seconds

2131
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,679
including your precious lives

2132
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,120
the second thing i the moment at least

2133
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,320
part of united states

2134
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,199
population is convinced that the danger

2135
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,000
is real

2136
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,159
they have to force their government and

2137
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,920
i'm not talking about sending letters

2138
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,440
signing petitions

2139
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,760
and all this beautiful noble activity

2140
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,800
i'm talking about

2141
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,000
forcing united states government to stop

2142
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,120
aiding communism because there is no

2143
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,159
other problem

2144
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:33,440
more burning and urgent than to stop the

2145
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,600
soviet military industrial complex

2146
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,760
from destroying what is whatever is left

2147
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,120
of the free world

2148
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,480
and it is very easy to do no credits

2149
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,199
no technology no money no political or

2150
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,560
diplomatic recognition

2151
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,560
and of course no such idiocy as grain

2152
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,800
deals to ussr

2153
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,520
the soviet people 270 millions of

2154
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,480
soviets will be

2155
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,679
eternally thankful to you if you stop

2156
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,400
aiding a bunch of murderers who sit now

2157
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,280
in kremlin

2158
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,199
and whom president dragon respectfully

2159
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,920
calls government they do not govern

2160
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,480
anything

2161
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,560
least of all such complexity as the

2162
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,320
soviet economy

2163
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,040
so basic two very simple maybe two

2164
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,560
simplistic answers

2165
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,120
or solutions but never nevertheless they

2166
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,239
are the only solutions educate yourself

2167
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,080
understand what's going on around you

2168
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,400
you are not living at the time of peace

2169
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,199
you are in a state of war and you have

2170
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:27,920
precious

2171
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,840
little time to save yourself um

2172
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,600
you don't have much time especially if

2173
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,360
you are talking about young generation

2174
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,840
there's not much time left for

2175
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,640
convulsions

2176
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,480
to the beautiful disco music

2177
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,000
very soon it will go just just overnight

2178
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,920
if we are talking about capitalists or

2179
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,120
or or

2180
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,920
wealthy businessmen they i think they

2181
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,840
are selling the rope on which they will

2182
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,199
hang very soon

2183
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,840
if they don't stop it they cannot curb

2184
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,480
their

2185
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,360
unsaturated desire for profit and if

2186
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,360
they keep on trading with the monster of

2187
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,440
the soviet communism

2188
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,159
they are going to hang very soon and it

2189
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,920
they will pray to be killed

2190
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,520
but unfortunately they will be sent to

2191
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,520
alaska probably to manage

2192
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,639
industry of slaves it's

2193
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,320
it's simplistic i know it sounds

2194
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,400
unpleasant i know americans don't like

2195
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,760
to listen to things which are

2196
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,480
unpleasant but i have defected not to

2197
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,600
tell you the stories

2198
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,960
about such idiocies as microfilm james

2199
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,080
bond type

2200
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,360
espionage this is garbage

2201
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,159
you don't need any espionage anymore i

2202
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,920
have come to talk about

2203
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,239
survival it's a question of survival of

2204
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,560
this system

2205
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,719
you may ask me what is it for me

2206
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:49,440
survival obviously because unlike

2207
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,120
i as i said i am now in your boat

2208
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,360
if we sing together we will sing

2209
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,880
beautifully together

2210
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,280
there is no other place on this planet

2211
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,840
to defect

2212
