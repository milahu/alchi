1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,829
our conversation is with mr. Yuri

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,670
Alexandrovich desmond othe ii when i

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,410
started working for the Soviet embassy

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,550
in India I to my horror I discovered

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,219
that we are millions times more

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,500
oppressive than any colonial or

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,600
imperialist power in the history of

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,840
mankind that my country brings to India

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,750
not freedom progress and friendship

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,099
between the nations but racism

11
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:31,949
exploitation and slavery and and of

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,809
course economical inefficiency to this

13
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,239
country since I fell in love with India

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,730
I I developed something which by KGB

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,950
standards is extremely dangerous thing

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,739
it's called split loyalty when an agent

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,750
likes a country of assignment more than

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,329
his own country I literally fell in love

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,760
with this beautiful country a country of

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,640
great contrasts but also great humility

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,760
great tolerance and if philosophical and

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,309
intellectual freedoms my ancestors used

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,770
to live in caves and eat raw meat when

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,010
India was highly civilized nation 6000

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,770
years ago so obviously the choice was

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,500
not to the advantage of my own nation I

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,640
decided to defect and to entirely

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,640
dissociate myself from the brutal regime

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,490
see first of all because defecting in

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,610
India is virtually impossible thanks to

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,200
very strong pressure from the Soviet

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,270
government excuse me you were in India

33
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,400
on assignment and yes I was working for

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,619
the Soviet embassy in New Delhi as a

35
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,439
press officer and defecting for a Soviet

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,869
diplomat is next to impossible it's a

37
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,259
suicide as I said because a great friend

38
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,619
Indira Gandhi pushed a law through

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,070
Parliament which says and I quote no

40
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,899
defector from any country has a right of

41
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,600
political asylum in any embassy on the

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,240
territory of Indian Republic which is a

43
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,549
masterpiece of hypocrisy no other

44
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,710
defector but the Soviet one needs a

45
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,530
political asylum so knowing that

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,389
perfectly well I I planned a craziest

47
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,730
possible way to defect

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,690
I started counterculture

49
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,360
in India there are there were thousands

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,320
of young American boys and girls with no

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,440
shoes long hair smoking hash and

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,850
marijuana studying sometimes Indian

53
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,980
philosophy sometimes simply pretending

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,400
that they study and they greatly annoyed

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
Indian police and they were

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,450
laughingstock of Indians because

57
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,010
obviously they they were

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,160
good-for-nothing students I started

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
carefully where they congregate what

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,390
roots they travel what language they

61
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,120
speak what do they smoke and one day I

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,090
simply joined a group of hippies to

63
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,480
avoid detection of Indian police I was

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,150
dressed as a typical hippie with blue

65
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,990
jeans long kameez shirts with all kind

66
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,930
of nice decorations like beads long

67
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,490
hairs I bought a wig because for several

68
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,320
weeks I had to turn myself from a

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,140
conservative Soviet diplomat into a very

70
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,050
progressive American hippie

71
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,750
my first assignment was to India as a

72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,730
translator with the Soviet economical

73
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,940
aid group building refinery complexes in

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,860
the heart state and which are at state

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,000
at the time I was still naively

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
idealistically believing that what I was

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,350
doing contributes to the understanding

78
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,290
and cooperation between the nations it

79
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,060
took me quite a number of years to

80
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,740
realize that what we were bringing to

81
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,970
India was a new type of colonialism

82
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,500
thousand times more oppressive and

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,100
exploitative than any colonialism or

84
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,790
imperialism in history of mankind but at

85
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,100
that time I was still hoping that well

86
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,110
maybe it's not that bad could be worse

87
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,260
and things may go for better and I even

88
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,410
tried to implement the beautiful Marxist

89
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,210
smarter proletarians of all the

90
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,030
countries unite I tried to unite with a

91
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,570
nice indian girl and I was actually I

92
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,820
was fascinated by Indian culture by by

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,480
the family life in in this country my

94
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,570
first assignment in India I was promoted

95
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,760
to the position of a public relations

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,400
officer you can see me here translating

97
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,880
a speech by a Soviet boss and you're on

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,950

99
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,530

the refinery complex in Bihar Baroni

101
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,680
another area of activity when I was

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,450
working for the novice tea was to

103
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,010
accompany groups of so-called

104
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,890
progressive intellectuals writers

105
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,790
journalists publishers teachers

106
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,270
professors of colleges you can see me

107
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,640
here in Kremlin I'm second on the left

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,890
with a group of Pakistani and Indian

109
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,910
intellectuals most of them pretend that

110
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,310
they don't understand that we are

111
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,470
actually working on behalf of the Soviet

112
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,380
government and the KGB they pretended

113
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,020
that they are actually being guests a

114
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,960
VIP intellectuals that they are treated

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,210
according to their merits and and their

116
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,910
intellectual abilities for us they were

117
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,060
just a bunch of political prostitutes to

118
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,680
be taken advantage for various

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,610
propaganda of

120
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,979
Asians therefore you can see perfectly

121
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,340
well they senior colleague of mine on

122
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,500
the left doesn't really have that much

123
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,139
respect on his face and myself with a

124
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,250
very skeptical smile typical KGB

125
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,889
sarcastic smile anticipating another

126
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,520
victim of ideological brainwashing this

127
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,870
is how a typical conference in novice

128
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,500
tea headquarters in Moscow look likes

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,659
sitting in the middle is boris butakov

130
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,580
the then director of norms depress

131
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,159
agency high-ranking party bureaucrat in

132
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,560
the department of propaganda I am

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,139
standing next to a famous Indian poet

134
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,590
Sumitra and on punt he was famous

135
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,409
because he was an author he was the

136
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,250
author of the famous poem titled

137
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,659
Rhapsody to Lenin that's why he was

138
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:26,020
invited to USSR and everything was paid

139
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,529
by the Soviet government the pay special

140
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,240
attention to number of bottles on the

141
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,389
table this is one of the ways to kill

142
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,349
the awareness or curiosity of the

143
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,810
foreign journalists my one of my

144
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,870
functions was to keep foreign guests

145
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,490
permanently intoxicated the moment they

146
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,250
land at Moscow Airport I had to take

147
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,949
them to the VIP launch and toast to

148
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,810
friendship and understanding within the

149
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,479
nations of the world glass of vodka then

150
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,029
the second glass of vodka and in no time

151
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,009
my guests would be feeling very happy

152
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,810
they would see everything in kind of

153
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,339
pink nice color and that's the way I I

154
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,949
had to keep them permanently for the

155
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,569
next 15 or 20 days at certain point in

156
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,789
time I had to withdraw alcohol from them

157
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:17,979
so that some of them were the most

158
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,539
recruitable would feel a little bit

159
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,029
shaky guilty trying to remember what

160
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,189
they were talking last night that's the

161
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,139
time to approach them with all kind of

162
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,689
nonsense such as joint communique or

163
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,080
statement for for Soviet propaganda

164
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,129
that's the time they aren't the most

165
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,159
flexible and of course what they didn't

166
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,289
understand they didn't realize or

167
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,810
pretended not to realize that myself who

168
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,880
was drinking together with them

169
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,190
was not drinking at all I had ways to

170
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,470
get rid of alcohol through various

171
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,319
techniques including special peels which

172
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,990
were given to me by my colleagues but

173
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,669
they were taking it seriously in other

174
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,349
words they they they would consume quite

175
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,889
large volumes of alcohol and feel quite

176
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,849
uneasy next morning this is the first

177
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,009
stage of befriending a professor you can

178
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,750
see myself on the left with the same

179
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,810
James Bond smile on my on the right is

180
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,389
my KGB supervisor comrade Leonid metro

181
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,430
Keon and in the middle a professor of

182
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,250
political science in Delhi University

183
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,110
the next stage would be to invite him to

184
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,240
a gathering of in the Soviet Friendship

185
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,310
Society there he is sitting next to his

186
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,940
wife before he is being sent to USSR for

187
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,979
free trip everything is paid by the

188
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,589
Soviet government he was made to believe

189
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,110
that he is invited to USSR because he is

190
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,270
a talented sober thinking intellectual

191
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,770
absolutely false he is invited because

192
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,690
he is a useful idiot because he would

193
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,240
agree and subscribe to most of the

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,910
Soviet propaganda cliche and when he is

195
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,100
coming back to his own country he is

196
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,800
going for years and years to teach the

197
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,100
beauties of Soviet socialism to newer

198
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,290
and newer generations of his students

199
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,420
thus promoting the Soviet propaganda

200
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,320
line part of the building of USSR

201
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,540
embassy and my supervisors on the left

202
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,480
is comrade McGee an Indian communist and

203
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
on the right

204
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,350
comrade Metro him my supervisors in the

205
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,420
secret department of research and Contra

206
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,850
propaganda it has nothing to do with

207
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,709
either research or country propaganda

208
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,680
most of the activity of the department

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,010
was to compile huge ammount volume of

210
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,890
information on individuals who were

211
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,730
instrumental in creating public opinion

212
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,410
publishers editors journalists actors

213
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,970
educationalists professors of political

214
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,020
science members of parliament

215
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,390
representatives of business circles most

216
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,070
of these people were divided roughly

217
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,290
into groups those who would toe the

218
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,060
Soviet foreign policy they would be

219
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,740
promoted to the positions of power

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,400
through media and

221
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,380
the opinion manipulation those who

222
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,300
refuse the Soviet influence in their own

223
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,280
country would be character assassinated

224
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,580
or executed physically come revolution

225
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,530
under the guidance of the Soviet embassy

226
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,540
in Hanoi and same thing I was doing in

227
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,970
New Delhi to my horror I discovered that

228
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,400
in the files where people were doomed to

229
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,790
execution there were names of pro-soviet

230
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,310
journalists with whom I was personally

231
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,160
friendly pressure of him yes they were

232
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,490
idealistically minded leftists who made

233
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,910
several visits to USSR and yet the KGB

234
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,250
decided that come revolution or drastic

235
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,740
changes in political structure of India

236
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,680
they will have to go wise not because

237
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,160
they know too much simply because you

238
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,500
see the useful idiots the the leftists

239
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,900
who are idealistic aliy believing in the

240
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,910
beauty of soviet socialist or communist

241
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,520
or whatever system when they get

242
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,110
disillusioned they become the worst

243
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,770
enemies that's why my KGB instructors

244
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,570
specifically made the point never bother

245
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,850
with leftists forget about these

246
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,180
political prostitutes aim higher this

247
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,770
was my instruction try to get into into

248
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,300
large circulation established

249
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,540
conservative media reach filthy rich

250
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,420
movie makers intellectuals so-called

251
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,210
academic circles cynical egocentric

252
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,100
people who can look into your eyes with

253
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,080
angelic expression and tell you a lie

254
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,780
this are the most recruitable people

255
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,390
people who lack moral principles who are

256
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,690
either too greedy or to suffer from

257
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,790
self-importance

258
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,690
they feel that they they matter a lot

259
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,820
these are the people who KGB wanted very

260
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,700
much to recruit but to eliminate the

261
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,620
others to execute the others don't they

262
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,240
serve some purpose wouldn't they be not

263
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,980
one they realize they serve purpose only

264
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,350
at the stage of destabilization of a

265
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,320
nation for example your leftists in

266
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
United States all these professors and

267
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,430
all this beautiful civil rights

268
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,340
defenders they are instrumental in the

269
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,180
process of the of the subversion only to

270
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,940
disturb you lies the nation

271
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,700
when their job is completed they are

272
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,620
known they are not needed anymore they

273
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,920
know too much some of them when they get

274
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,870
disillusioned when they see that Marxist

275
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,030
Leninist come to power obviously they

276
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,040
get offended they think that they will

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,350
come to power that will never happen of

278
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,000
course they will be lined up against the

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
wall and shot but they may turn into the

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,640
most bitter enemies of Marxist Leninist

281
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,680
when most of the Indians who were

282
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,110
cooperating with the Soviets especially

283
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,460
without the Department of Information of

284
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,040
the USSR embassy were listed for

285
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,520
execution and when I discovered that

286
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,280
fact of course I was sick I was mentally

287
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,230
and physically sick I thought the time

288
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,750
I'm going to explode one day during the

289
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,430
briefing at the ambassador's office I

290
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,350
would stand up and say something that we

291
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,700
are basically a bunch of murderers

292
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,160
that's what we are we yeah there's

293
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,690
nothing to do with friendship and

294
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,460
understanding between the nation and

295
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,040
blah blah blah we're murderers we behave

296
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,650
as a bunch of thugs in the country which

297
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,930
which is hospitable to us a country

298
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,230
which which with ancient traditions but

299
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,690
I I did not the fact I tried to get the

300
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,430
message across to my horror

301
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,950
nobody wanted even to listen least of

302
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,890
all to believe what I had to say and I

303
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,750
tried all kinds of tricks I would I

304
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,170
would I would leak information through

305
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,960
letters or lost documents or something

306
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,150
like that and still I got no message the

307
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,190
message was not published even in the

308
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,610
conservative mass media of India the

309
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,620
immediate impulse to defect was

310
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,750
Bangladesh crisis which was described by

311
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,810
American correspondence as Islamic

312
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,600
grassroot Revolution which is absolute

313
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
baloney there was nothing to do with

314
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,040
Islam and there was no grassroot

315
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,420
revolution actually there are no

316
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,430
grassroot revolutions period any

317
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,530
revolution is a byproduct of a highly

318
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,710
organized group of conscientious and

319
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,070
professional and organizers but there's

320
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,080
nothing to do with grassroot in

321
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,390
Bangladesh it was nothing

322
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,210
with grassroots most of the Awami League

323
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,670
party members of a mulignans People's

324
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,850
Party were trained in Moscow in the hi

325
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,430
party school most of the Mukti fauj

326
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,800
leaders Mukti forages in Bengali means

327
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,680
People's Army same as SWAPO and and all

328
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,630
kind of Liberation Army's all over the

329
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,089
world the same bunch of useful idiots

330
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,770
they were trained at Lumumba University

331
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,770
and various centres of the KGB in

332
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,240
Simferopol in in Crimea and in Tashkent

333
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,790
so when I saw that India Indian

334
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,130
territory is being used as a jumping

335
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,110
board to destroy East Pakistan

336
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,170
I saw myself thousands of so-called

337
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,709
students traveling through India to East

338
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,900
Pakistan through the territory of India

339
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,330
and Indian government pretended not to

340
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,280
see what was going on they knew

341
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,870
perfectly well the Indian pollutin knew

342
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,120
it the intelligence Department of Indian

343
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,250
government knew it the KGB of course

344
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,920
knew it and the CIA knew it that that

345
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,810
was most infuriating because when I

346
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,670
defected and I explained to the CIA

347
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,070
debriefers they should watch out because

348
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,930
East Pakistan is going to erupt any

349
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,420
moment they said I was look I was

350
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,959
reading to too many James Bond novels

351
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,950
anyway so East Pakistan was doomed

352
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,839
one of my colleagues in in the Soviet

353
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,700
consulate in Calcutta when he was dead

354
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,680
drunk he ventured into the basement to

355
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,410
relieve himself and he found the big

356
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,380
boxes which said printed matter to Dhaka

357
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,510
University

358
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,500
Dhaka is the capital of East Pakistan

359
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,770
and since he was drunk and curious he

360
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,330
opened one of the boxes and he

361
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,100
discovered not printed metric he

362
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,720
discovered Kalashnikov guns and

363
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,000
ammunition in there anyway it's a long

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,520
story when I saw the preparations for

365
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,130
the for the invasion into East Pakistan

366
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,700
obviously I wanted to defect immediately

367
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,589
the only thing I couldn't I couldn't at

368
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:05,620
that time make up my mind when and where

369
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,470
and how one of the reasons of course you

370
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,839
see I was in love with the India I

371
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,970
mentioned it before I spoke the

372
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,000
languages I socialized with people and I

373
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,570
understood that I had to act fast unless

374
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,810
I want this beautiful country to be

375
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,579
permanently and irreparably damaged by

376
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,160
our presence

377
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:36,220
