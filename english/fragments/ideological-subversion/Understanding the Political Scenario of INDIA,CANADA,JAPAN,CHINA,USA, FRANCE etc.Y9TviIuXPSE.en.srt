1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,550
this videos not mine it is a lecture

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,370
video given by Thomas Schumann his real

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,740
name is Yuri basmanov he gave this

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,290
lecture back in 1980s it took me a while

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,240
to find this golden nugget and the

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
reason I uploaded this video on my

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,960
channel is because it is a great lecture

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,250
that helps us in understanding the

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,199
current political scenario both around

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,880
the world as well as in our own country

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,580
and I believe it needs to be seen after

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,260
watching this you will be able to relate

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,910
what is happening today in many Western

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,939
societies like America in Europe and

15
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,900
unfortunately it is also happening in

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,149
India since it's a long video please

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,640
watch it whenever you have time and

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,870
maybe you all get a bit more educated

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,800
the video starts now subversion is the

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,690
term if you're looking at in a

21
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,149
dictionary or criminal code to that

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,590
matter usually his explained as a part

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,430
of activity to destroy things like

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,969
religion government system political

25
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,609
economical system of a country and

26
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,799
usually it's linked to espionage and

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,869
such romantic things as blowing up

28
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,310
bridges sidetracking trains clock and

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,080
dagger activity in Hollywood style when

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,869
what I'm going to talk about now has

31
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,840
absolutely nothing to do with the cliche

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,740
of espionage or KGB activity of

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,729
collecting information so the greatest

34
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,790
mistake or missmiss misconception I

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,030
think is that whenever we are talking

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,290
about KGB for some strange reason

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,150
starting from Hollywood movie makers to

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,049
professors of political science and

39
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,570
quote-unquote experts on Soviet affairs

40
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,700
or criminologists as they call

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,790
themselves they think that the most

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,130
desirable thing for undraw off and the

43
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,009
whole KGB is to steal blueprints of some

44
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,579
supersonic jet bring it back to Soviet

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,240
Union and sell it to the Soviet military

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,929
industrial complex it's only partly true

47
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,459
if if we take

48
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:18,280
the whole time money and manpower that

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,099
the Soviet Union and KGB in particular

50
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,200
spends outside of USSR border we will

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
discover of course there are no official

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,510
statistics our banquet CIA or FBI the

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,389
the espionage and such occupies only ten

54
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:42,069
to fifteen percent of money time and

55
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,439
manpower 50 percent of the activity of

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,329
KGB the rest eighty five percent is

57
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:56,560
always subversion and unlike a

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,569
dictionary of English

59
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,180
Oxford Dictionary subversion in Soviet

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,879
terminology means always a destructive

61
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,889
aggressive activity aimed to destroy the

62
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,799
country nation or geographical area of

63
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,370
your enemy so there is no romantics in

64
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,139
there absolutely no blowing up bridges

65
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,989
no micro films in coca-cola cans nothing

66
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,400
of that sort not James Bond nonsense its

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,549
most of this activity in all word

68
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,439
legitimate and easily observable if you

69
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,090
give yourself time and trouble to

70
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,939
observe it but according to the law and

71
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:41,739
law enforcement systems of the Western

72
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,579
civilization it's not a crime exactly

73
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,220
because of misconception manipulation of

74
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,769
terms we think that subvert er is a

75
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:52,989
person who is going to blow up our

76
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,129
beautiful bridges no subvert er is a

77
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,709
student who come for exchange a diplomat

78
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,979
an actor an artist a journalist like

79
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,579
myself was ten years ago now subversion

80
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:14,949
is an activity which is a two-way

81
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:15,669
traffic

82
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,149
you cannot subvert an enemy which

83
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,020
doesn't want to be subverted if you know

84
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,060
history of Japan for example

85
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,879
before 30th century Japan was a closed

86
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,810
society the moment a foreign boat comes

87
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,569
to the shores of Japan the Imperial

88
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,759
Japanese Army politely tell them to get

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,199
lost and if American salesman comes to

90
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,020
the shore of Japan let's say 60 or 70

91
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,930
years from now back and says oh I have a

92
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,819
very beautiful vacuum cleaner for you

93
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,419
know that the good financing is please

94
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,990
leave us with the media vacuum cleaner

95
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,590
if they don't leave they shoot them to

96
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,840
preserve their culture ideology

97
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,409
traditions values in fact you were not

98
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,169
able to separate Japan you cannot

99
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,000
separate Soviet Union because the

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,180
borders are closed the media is censored

101
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,310
by the government the population is

102
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,800
controlled by the KGB and internal

103
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,529
police with all the beautiful glossy

104
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:27,169
pictures of Time magazine and magazine

105
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,620
America which is published but by the

106
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,759
American Embassy in Moscow

107
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,039
you can not subvert Soviet citizens

108
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,080
because the magazine never reaches

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,349
Soviet citizens it's collected from

110
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,419
their new stance and thrown to garbage

111
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,279
can subversion can be only successful

112
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,060
when the initiator they act or the act

113
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,339
the agent of subversion has a responsive

114
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,750
target it's a two-way traffic the United

115
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,819
States is a receptive target of

116
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:09,080
subversion there is no response similar

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,810
to that one from United States to the

118
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,960
Soviet Union it stops halfway somewhere

119
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,409
it never reaches here the theory of

120
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:22,639
subversion goes all the way back 2500

121
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,229
years ago the first human being who

122
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,719
formulated the tactics of subversion was

123
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,270
a Chinese philosopher by the name of

124
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,259
sunset

125
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,230
to 3,500 years bc was an advisor for

126
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,720
several Imperial courts and in ancient

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,120
China and he said after long meditation

128
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,810
that to implement foreign birth to

129
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,200
implement state policy in a world like

130
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,360
manner it's the most counterproductive

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,370
barbaric and inefficient to fight on a

132
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,420
battlefield you know that war is

133
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,670
continuation of state policy right so if

134
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,530
you want successfully to implement your

135
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,680
state policy and you start fighting this

136
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,530
is the most idiotic way to do it the

137
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,370
highest art of warfare is not to fight

138
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,260
at all but to subvert anything of value

139
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,680
in the country of your enemy until such

140
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,530
time that the perception of reality of

141
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,540
your enemy is screwed up to such an

142
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,940
extent that it does not perceive you as

143
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,930
an enemy and that your system your

144
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,580
civilization and your four ambitions

145
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,010
look to your enemy as an alternative if

146
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,650
not desirable then at least visible

147
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,550
better red than dead does the ultimate

148
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,640
purpose the final stage of subversion

149
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,320
after which you can simply take your

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,070
enemy without a single shot being fired

151
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,530
if the subversion is successful this is

152
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,770
basically what subversion is as you see

153
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,190
not the single mentioning of blowing up

154
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,750
bridges of course sons that didn't know

155
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,270
about blowing up bridges maybe they were

156
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,700
not that many bridges at that time but

157
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,479
the basics of subversion is being taught

158
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,200
to every student of KGB school in USSR

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,220
and to officers of military academies

160
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm not sure if the same author is

161
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,550
included in the list of reading for

162
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,940
American or

163
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,580
is to say nothing about ordinary

164
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,550
students of political science I have

165
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,560
difficulty to find the translation of

166
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,460
Sansa in in the library of a university

167
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,130
in Toronto and later on here in Los

168
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,850
Angeles but it's a it's a book which is

169
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,710
not available

170
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,790
it is forced to every students in USSR

171
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,280
every students who is taught to be

172
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,860
dealing further in his future career

173
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,100
with foreigners

174
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,410
what subversion is basically it consists

175
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,210
of four periods timewise if we start

176
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,060
from here and go this way time right

177
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,130
this is the beginning point the first

178
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,620
stage of subversion is the process which

179
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,520
is called basically demoralization says

180
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,690
for itself what it is

181
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:54,100
it takes from say 15 to 20 years to

182
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,959
demoralize a society-wide by 15 or 20

183
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,249
years this is the time sufficient to

184
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:08,829
educate one generation of students or

185
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,680
children one generation one lifetime

186
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,329
span of a person a human being which is

187
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:20,379
dedicated to study to shaping up the

188
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:25,089
outlook ideology personality no more or

189
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,509
less usually it takes from 15 to 20

190
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:32,759
years what it includes it includes

191
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,980
influencing or by various methods

192
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,089
infiltration propaganda methods direct

193
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,100
contacts doesn't really matter I will

194
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,360
describe them later of various areas

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,430
where public opinion is formulated or

196
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,910
shaped religion educational system

197
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,300
social life administration law

198
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,769
enforcement system military of course

199
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:09,040
and labor and employer relations economy

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,779
okay

201
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,110
five areas I will not write them down

202
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,069
because will not have enough space some

203
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:20,350
sometimes when I describe all the

204
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,279
methods students ask me question are you

205
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,429
sure this is the result of the Soviet

206
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,550
influence not necessarily you see the

207
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,040
tactic of subversion about which I'm

208
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,009
talking it's similar to the martial art

209
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,189
the Japanese martial art if you're if

210
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,839
some of you familiar with that tactic

211
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,699
probably you will remember that it an

212
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,620
enemy is bigger and heavier than

213
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,559
yourself it would be very painful to

214
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,269
resist his direct strike if a heavier

215
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,790
person wants to strike me in the face it

216
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,589
would be very naive and

217
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,079
counterproductive to stop his blow

218
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,999
the Chinese and Japanese judo art tells

219
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:08,119
us what to do first to avoid the stripe

220
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,899
then to grab the fist and continue his

221
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,230
movement in the direction where it was

222
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,189
before right until the enemy crashes in

223
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:23,199
the wall you see so what happens here

224
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,379
the target country obviously does

225
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,569
something wrong if it's a free

226
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:32,059
democratic society there are many

227
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:35,649
different movements within the society

228
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,889
there obviously in every society there

229
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,839
are people who are against the society

230
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,480
they may be simple criminals

231
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,920
ideologically in disagreement with with

232
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,889
state policy conscientious enemies

233
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,410
simply psychotic personalities who are

234
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,829
against anything right and finally there

235
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,649
are a small group of agents of a foreign

236
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:04,399
nation but subverted recruited right the

237
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,490
moment all these movements will be

238
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,389
directed in one direction right this is

239
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,339
the time to catch the movement and to

240
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,299
continue it until the movement forces

241
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,939
the whole society into collapse into

242
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:22,579
crisis right so that's exactly the

243
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,790
martial art tactic we don't stop an

244
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,209
enemy we let him go with helping to go

245
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,549
in the direction we want them to go and

246
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,949
so on the stage of demoralization

247
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,299
obviously there are tendencies in each

248
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:42,819
society in each country which are going

249
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:45,709
to opposite direction from the basic

250
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,019
moral values and principles to take

251
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,629
advantage of these movements to

252
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,569
capitalize on them is the main purpose

253
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:56,629
of the originator of subversion so we

254
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,589
have religion we have education we have

255
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,209
social life we have power structure we

256
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,839
have labor relations unions and finally

257
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,319
we have law and order one two three four

258
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,580
five six

259
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,620
okay these are the areas of application

260
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,060
of subversion what it means exactly in

261
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,400
case of religion destroy ridicule it

262
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,490
replaces the various sex cults which

263
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,400
bring people's attention faith whether

264
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,020
it is naive primitive doesn't really

265
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,250
matter as long as the basically accepted

266
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,760
religious dogma is being slowly eroded

267
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,930
and taken away from the supreme purpose

268
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,350
of religion to keep people in touch with

269
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,690
with the Supreme Being that serves the

270
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,950
purpose therefore Ripley is accepted

271
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,920
respected religious organizations with

272
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,850
fake organizations distract people

273
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,810
attention from the real faith and

274
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,140
attract them to various different faiths

275
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,210
education distract them from learning

276
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,540
something which is constructive

277
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,510
pragmatic efficient instead of

278
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,050
mathematics physics foreign languages

279
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,940
chemistry teach them history of urban

280
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:31,010
warfare natural food home economy your

281
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,460
sexuality anything long as it takes you

282
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,810
away okay social life replace

283
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,700
traditionally established institutions

284
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,440
and organizations with fake

285
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,290
organizations take away the initiative

286
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,680
from people take away the responsibility

287
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,120
from naturally established links between

288
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,980
individuals group of individuals and

289
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,990
society at large and replace them with

290
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,270
artificially bureaucratically controlled

291
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,530
bodies instead of social life and

292
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,650
friendship between neighbors establish

293
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,000
social workers institutions the people

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,270
who are on payroll of whom society no

295
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,570
bureaucracy the main concern of social

296
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,940
workers is not your family not you not

297
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,530
social relations different groups of

298
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,140
people the main concern is to get the

299
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,600
paycheck from the

300
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,040
what will be the result of their social

301
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
work doesn't really matter they can

302
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,459
develop all kind of concepts to show

303
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,160
them to show to the government and for

304
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,250
the people that they're useful okay away

305
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,220
from the natural links power structure

306
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,790
okay the natural bodies of

307
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,449
administration which are traditionally

308
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,009
either elected by by people at lodge or

309
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,139
appointed by elected leaders of society

310
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,959
are being actively substituted by

311
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,130
artificial bodies the bodies of people

312
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,970
groups of people who nobody elected

313
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,770
never as a matter of fact most of the

314
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,740
people don't like them at all and yet

315
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,839
they exist

316
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,329
one of such group is media who elected

317
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:24,089
them how can they they think they have

318
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,049
so much power

319
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,079
almost monopolistic power on your mind

320
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,230
they can rape your mind but who elected

321
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,020
them how come they are they have a nerve

322
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,730
to decide what is good and what is bad

323
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,450
for for the elected by you president and

324
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,610
his administration who the hell are they

325
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,429
Spiro Agnew who was hated by the liberal

326
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,280
left call them a bunch of enfeebled

327
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,710
snobs and that's exactly what they are

328
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,799
they think they know they don't the

329
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,159
level of mediocracy in a big

330
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,990
establishment like New York Times Los

331
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,150
Angeles time major television network

332
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,159
you don't have to be excellent

333
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,159
journalist you have to be exactly a

334
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,440
mediocre journalist that's easier to

335
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,150
survive there's no competition anymore

336
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,510
you have your good nice income one

337
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,610
hundred thousand dollars a year that's

338
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,679
it whether you are better or worse it

339
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,330
doesn't really matter anymore as soon as

340
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,090
you're smiling to the camera and do your

341
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,020
job no more no more competition

342
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,190
power structure slowly is eroded by the

343
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,679
bodies and groups of people who do not

344
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,080
have neither qualifications nor the will

345
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,110
of people to keep them in power and yet

346
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,280
they do have power okay together with

347
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,830
that there's another process law

348
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,530
enforcement law and order organization

349
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,290
and structure is being eroded for the

350
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,770
last 2025 years you you if you see all

351
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,130
movies and new movies you can see that a

352
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,950
new movies a policeman an officer of the

353
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,460
United States Army looks dumb angry

354
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,330
psychotic paranoid a criminal looks nice

355
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,630
kind of well he smokes hash and and

356
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,320
shoots the whatever drug but basically

357
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,650
he's a nice human being he's creative

358
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,440
and he's unproductive only because

359
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,380
society oppresses him whereby a general

360
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,230
Pentagon is always by definition dumb a

361
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,790
war maniac a policeman is a big rude

362
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,900
policeman he abuses his power no a

363
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,890
generality generalization like that the

364
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,580
hatred the mistrust to the people who's

365
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,520
supposed to protect you and enforce law

366
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,790
and order moral relativity the Angela

367
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,770
Warner process lasted two years in Los

368
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,860
Angeles a little et the Angela Borna

369
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,750
process lasted two years in Los Angeles

370
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,450
and yet there are still some lawyers and

371
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,910
say look he's a nice character as a

372
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,770
matter of fact there were some witness

373
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,770
who said also a criminal who said well

374
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,900
he's a nice guy I asked him one day to

375
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,210
burn a house of my enemy and he wouldn't

376
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,870
do it

377
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,530
[Laughter]

378
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,470
a slow substitution of basic moral

379
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,160
principles whereby a criminal is not a

380
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,670
criminal actually he's a defendant even

381
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,240
if his guilt is proven there is still

382
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,960
adult to kill or not that you to be or

383
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,950
not to be thou shalt not kill yes but

384
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,440
this line may not necessarily be

385
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,180
applicable to a murderer

386
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,030
thou shalt not murder that should be the

387
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,400
the presumption not not that I shall not

388
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,020
kill okay regulations at this stage

389
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,500
within fifteen to twenty years we

390
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,850
destroy the traditional established

391
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,370
links of bargaining between employer and

392
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,190
employee the classical Marxist Leninist

393
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,440
theory of natural exchange of goods the

394
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,660
person a has five sacks of grain and

395
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,920
person B has five pairs of shoes and the

396
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,200
natural exchange without money is when

397
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,370
they bargain between each other and only

398
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,720
with the introduction of the third for C

399
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,990
an entirely third foreign stranger who

400
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,940
says no don't give him five sacks of

401
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,460
grain give it to me and you give you

402
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,350
your five pairs of shoes and I will

403
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,410
distribute it accordingly so that the

404
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,270
economy will go this is the death of

405
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,760
natural exchange that death of natural

406
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,380
bargaining well trade unions were

407
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,200
established hundred years ago the

408
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,940
objective was to improve working

409
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,370
conditions and to protect the rights of

410
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,000
workers from those employers who are

411
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,540
abusing their their right because they

412
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,690
had more money objectively at that time

413
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,540
initially the trade union movement deep

414
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,480
work what we see now is that the

415
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,670
bargaining pot process is no longer

416
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,560
resulting into in the compromise which

417
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,860
is leading objectively to betterment of

418
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,269
working conditions and

419
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:39,629
increase of salary what we see is that

420
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:42,749
after each prolonged strike the workers

421
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:46,440
lose even if they have 10% increase of

422
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,719
their salaries they cannot catch up due

423
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,839
to inflation and due to missed time more

424
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,570
than that millions of people suffer from

425
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,279
that strike because economy now is

426
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,169
interdependent it's intertwined like one

427
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,219
body if previously still workers say

428
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,019
hundred years ago could strike and

429
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,200
nobody would suffer now it's impossible

430
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,509
anymore if a garbage collector strikes

431
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:15,509
today the rest of the multi-million city

432
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,679
is stinking I mean that there's no more

433
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,899
service in Quebec for example we have

434
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,879
the electricians who are in strike in

435
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,570
the middle of winter you can freeze your

436
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,259
bottom and they still weren't strike did

437
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,940
they catch up with the Saudi no they

438
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,729
lost who benefited the leaders of trade

439
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:38,989
union what is the motivation for strike

440
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:41,789
improving improving at work a workers

441
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:46,940
condition no it's not then what is it

442
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,649
ideology to prove to these capitalists

443
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,989
and the obedient horde of workers like

444
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:57,119
ship follow these people and they cannot

445
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,209
disobey why because if they do you know

446
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:03,329
what happens to them tickets murders

447
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:07,409
shooting truck drivers by picketers in

448
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,389
Montreal for example I saw with my own

449
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:11,570
eyes when I was correspondent of CBC

450
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,619
international Canadian Broadcasting

451
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,139
Corporation when the workers of aircraft

452
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:19,440
factory destroyed computers and the

453
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,919
equipment in the factory and they the

454
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,440
administration employed strike breakers

455
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,019
their cars were turned upside down and

456
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,559
burned their houses were burned their

457
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,409
kids were intimidated and some victims

458
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,609
were there of that you can be sure why

459
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,849
to improve conditions of workers no

460
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:44,759
ideology okay so this is what happens

461
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,630
basically

462
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,029
it may or may not happen without the

463
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,759
help of the Soviet Union but the natural

464
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,210
tendencies are being greatly taken

465
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,279
advantage of and capitalized by the

466
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,210
Soviet propaganda systems how whenever

467
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,740
trade union strikes

468
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,860
we have influx of propaganda mass media

469
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,799
ideological dissemination the workers

470
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,169
right and repeated like parrots

471
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:13,360
yes workers right whose rights workers

472
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,350
know the only freedom of workers to sell

473
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,929
his labour according to his own desire

474
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:22,000
and will is taken away from him by whom

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,990
by trade union boss unlimited power is

476
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,059
given responsibility I want to sell my

477
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,850
labor not for 250 an hour but for 2

478
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,879
dollars I don't have right my freedom is

479
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,850
denied to me I know that if I sell my

480
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,610
work for to hunt for $2 an hour not for

481
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,129
3 dollars now I will compete better with

482
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,440
the other guy who is lazy and more

483
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,590
greedy I don't need to $3 I need only 2

484
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,200
dollars no I was made to believe by

485
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,840
media by business by advertising

486
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,029
agencies that I need more and more and

487
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,309
more have you ever heard any advertising

488
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:03,940
on TV to consume less no no way whether

489
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,970
you need a six-cylinder car or not you

490
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:14,019
have to buy it and hurry up on the local

491
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,379
radio station an excited announcer said

492
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:20,440
you hurry up rush and save save save

493
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,330
there is a pantyhose a sale

494
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:33,440
same by buying more of course of course

495
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,290
if before the tuna if you expect the KGB

496
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,900
makes that advertising agency to do such

497
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,500
a crazy commercial no of course not

498
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,570
but what we did when I was working for

499
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,600
NOAA secrecy we would snow plow

500
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,080
editorial offices student organizations

501
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,330
religious group with literature of class

502
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,230
struggle may if not directly Marxist

503
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,160
Leninist propaganda then a propaganda of

504
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,320
of illegitimate aspirations of

505
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,660
working-class betterment of life

506
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,549
equality equality mind you President

507
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,620
Kennedy once said people we will make

508
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,270
America to believe that people who are

509
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,620
born equal our people born equal is

510
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,230
there any mentioning in the Bible or any

511
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,980
other Holy Scripture in any religion any

512
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,570
religion if you don't believe me go to

513
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,880
library and check it there is not a

514
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,510
single word about equality

515
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:36,440
just the opposite by your deeds God will

516
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,980
judge you what you do is important the

517
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,000
merit of your personality you cannot

518
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,370
legislate equality if you want to be

519
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,860
equal you have to be equal you have to

520
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,720
deserve it

521
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,620
and yet we built our society on the

522
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,630
principle of equality we say people are

523
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,490
equal you know it is false it's a lie

524
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,100
some people are tall and stupid others

525
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,860
are short bald and clever

526
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,680
[Laughter]

527
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:25,630
if we make them if we make them equal by

528
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,880
force if we put the principle of

529
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,510
equality in the basis of our

530
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,580
socio-political structure is the same

531
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,660
thing as building a house on sand sooner

532
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,760
or later it will collapse and that's

533
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,299
exactly what happens and we as solid

534
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,120
propaganda makers are trying to push you

535
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,270
in the direction which you go yourself

536
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,890
equality yes the quality people are

537
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,900
equal land of equal opportunities is it

538
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,830
true or not think about it

539
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,630
equal opportunities should they be equal

540
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,809
opportunities for me and for lazy

541
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,030
bastards who come here from some other

542
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,370
country and immediately registers as a

543
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,240
welfare recipient benefit I never

544
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,039
received a single dot note sorry I

545
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,650
didn't visit once but I never applied

546
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,530
for welfare for the 13 years I took any

547
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,880
job security guard journalists taxi

548
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,120
driver anything well I was Restless but

549
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,970
some people don't like it they

550
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,500
immediately so why should we be it why

551
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,380
should we have equal opportunities why

552
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,059
the equal opportunity to excel equal

553
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,820
opportunity in equal circumstances yes

554
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,470
but you know people are different to

555
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,500
excel yes provided we reach the same

556
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,520
level of excellency perfection which is

557
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,659
hypothetical distant future yes maybe

558
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,880
but we know perfectly well that even the

559
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,240
best intentions people could not be

560
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,730
equal why should we have equality in the

561
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,350
same legal system myself I'm considering

562
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,320
myself a law abiding citizen and the

563
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,990
person who comes here to rob and shoot

564
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,960
safer the United States Administration

565
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,960
under Carter imported thousands of Cuban

566
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,640
criminal they were non criminal yet they

567
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,610
were accepted do you think it's fair if

568
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,830
myself and my wife from Philippines who

569
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,820
work like excuse me as a lab

570
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,770
technician and in the hospital should

571
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,799
have the same rights as a criminal film

572
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,070
from Cuba why

573
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,309
and yet we repeat as parrots equality

574
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:57,039
equality equality and the solid

575
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,840
propaganda system helps us to believe

576
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,370
that equality is something which is

577
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,830
desirable democracy as it was

578
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,419
established by fathers of this country

579
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:08,860
of the system and the last century is is

580
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,610
not equality is the system where

581
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,580
different people unequal people have a

582
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,210
chance to survive and help each other in

583
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,580
constant competition in constant

584
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,000
perfection not in equality which is

585
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,570
super imposed from from a godfather or a

586
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,429
nice person in Washington DC and the

587
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:36,340
absolute equality exists in Soviet Union

588
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,279
quote unquote equality everybody is

589
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,659
equal in in dirt except some people are

590
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:45,279
more equal than the others in fully

591
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,330
Bureau so the moment you you bring a

592
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,330
country to the point of almost start

593
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,520
with the mobilization when nothing works

594
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,340
anymore when you are not sure that is

595
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,480
right or or wrong good and bad but there

596
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,340
is no division between evil and good

597
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,190
when even the leaders of church

598
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,100
sometimes say well violence for the sake

599
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,649
of justice especially social justice is

600
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:17,080
justified in a countries like Nicaragua

601
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,909
and Salvador well maybe Rhodesia and we

602
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:24,039
listen to them and say here probably

603
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,669
it's true is it true no it is not true

604
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:30,700
violence is not justified especially for

605
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,039
the sake of quote unquote social justice

606
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,799
introduced by Marxist Leninist that is

607
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,289
my former colleagues from knowledge to

608
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,000
press agents in our case we reach that

609
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,300
point the next step is this

610
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,720
zatia

611
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,919
again this word says for itself what it

612
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,499
is to disturb you lies all the relations

613
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:57,789
all the accepted institutions and

614
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:00,169
organizations in a country of your enemy

615
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:03,259
how you do it you don't have to send up

616
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:06,110
a battalion of KGB agents to blow up

617
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,940
bridges no you let them do it themselves

618
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,580
the area of application is again it's

619
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,879
it's narrower now not like the previous

620
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,749
case the overt legitimate actions of the

621
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,679
of the KGB in this case would be hardly

622
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,139
noticeable there is no crime if a

623
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,330
professor who recently went to USSR

624
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,860
introduces the course of Marxism

625
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,100
Leninism in in a Californian college for

626
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,139
example nobody is going to come to his

627
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,619
doorstep and say okay mr. come you're

628
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:40,309
under arrest

629
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,169
no it's not a crime it's not even

630
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,389
considered a moral crime against your

631
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,509
country so the area of application here

632
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:52,279
is narrowing down to economy again labor

633
00:33:52,279 --> 00:34:00,350
relations right to law and order plus

634
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:07,700
military and economy law and order yes

635
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,750
and again the media but why does coke

636
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,069
little bit different I'll explain when

637
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:18,699
okay basically three areas the economy

638
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:23,480
the radicalization of bargaining process

639
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,299
if on that stage we still could achieve

640
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,040
theoretically some positive compromise

641
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,839
between the negotiating sides with with

642
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,859
say arbitrary an introduction of

643
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,559
arbitrary judges a third side and

644
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,109
objectively judging the the demands of

645
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:49,668
both side here it's radicalization on

646
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:51,980
this on the stage of disorganization we

647
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,949
cannot come to compromise even within a

648
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,989
family the husband and wife couldn't

649
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,869
figure out which is better husband wants

650
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,420
his kids to eat at the table and life

651
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,420
him a child to roam around the room and

652
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,940
and drop food all over the floor they

653
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,549
cannot come to compromise unless they

654
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:13,640
start a fight it's impossible to reach a

655
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,440
compromise constructive compromise

656
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,079
between neighbors some people say I

657
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,940
don't like you to work during you alone

658
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,740
at that time because exactly at that

659
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,900
time I'm walking my dog and he's getting

660
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,950
nervous he cannot pass his balls you

661
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,470
know so they cannot compromise they go

662
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,680
to a civil court or something like that

663
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,319
radicalization of human relations no

664
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:41,359
more compromise fight fight fight

665
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,970
the normal traditionally accepted

666
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,480
relations are destabilized the relations

667
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,839
between teachers and students in schools

668
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:55,130
and colleges fight the relations between

669
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,430
in economical sphere between Labour's

670
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,210
and and employers are further

671
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,430
radicalized no more acceptance of the

672
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,980
legitimacy of demands of workers unlike

673
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,440
Japanese with the theories if you ever

674
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,569
heard about it where the workers are

675
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:16,040
involved in the decision-making process

676
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,890
therefore they don't have model

677
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,579
incentive to to fight their bosses in

678
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,170
the United States has just the opposite

679
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,440
the harder is the fight the better the

680
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
more heroic they look when the Greyhound

681
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,510
network was on strike recently the

682
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,329
correspondence of local TV networks all

683
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,299
over the United States were approaching

684
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,640
these strikers and they say oh yes we

685
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,349
are doing something nice they look like

686
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:47,299
heroes and they were proud there was

687
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:51,609
some family the husband was a bus driver

688
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,040
now they decided in in the protest

689
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,430
against the bosses to camp somewhere in

690
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,520
the forest and they were presented to

691
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,250
the to the audience as as a heroic nice

692
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,660
people you see the violent clashes

693
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,059
between passengers ticket errs and the

694
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:13,160
strikers are presented as something

695
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,590
normal

696
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:19,810
10 15 20 years ago we would we would be

697
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,790
would be angry said why right why so

698
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,370
much hatred today we are not we say well

699
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,920
commonplace radicalization

700
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,720
militarization sometimes as I explained

701
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,080
on that stage I took a step a little bit

702
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,270
further shooting people

703
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:45,860
ok law and order now also is pushed into

704
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,460
the area where previously people settle

705
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,100
their differences peacefully and

706
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,340
legitimately now we are getting with us

707
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,880
court cases in them in the smallest

708
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,070
irrelevant cases we cannot solve our

709
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,190
problems anymore the society at large

710
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,360
becomes more and more antagonistic

711
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,800
between individuals between groups of

712
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,220
individuals and the society at large the

713
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,310
media puts himself in the opposition to

714
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,100
the society in general at large separate

715
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:29,030
alienated okay on that stage you

716
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,030
remember I was talking a couple of hours

717
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,690
ago about the sleepers that's when the

718
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,930
students from say United States if they

719
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,210
are trained in in Lumumba University or

720
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,160
developing nations that's the students I

721
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,150
was dealing with are being sent back

722
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,730
from the Soviet Union here or if they

723
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,800
were already in the United States in the

724
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,310
country

725
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,370
which is the object of subversion they

726
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,440
spring to action the sleepers go up they

727
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,940
slept for 15 to 20 years now they become

728
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:11,060
leaders of groups preachers I don't know

729
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,210
public public figures prominently they

730
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,940
actin they actively include themselves

731
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,550
in the political process all of a sudden

732
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,510
we see a homosexual 15 years ago he did

733
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,600
his dirty job and nobody cared now he

734
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,320
makes it a political

735
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,250
issue it's a political issue he demands

736
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,620
recognition respect human rights and

737
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,680
here all is a large group of people and

738
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,440
their violent clashes between him and

739
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,410
police his group and ordinary people no

740
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,420
matter what it's black against white

741
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,000
yellows again green doesn't matter

742
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
where's the vision line goes as long as

743
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,740
this group come into antagonistic

744
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,770
question sometimes militantly sometimes

745
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,700
with firearms that is the stabilization

746
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,850
process the sleepers many of whom are

747
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:07,680
simply KGB agents become leaders of the

748
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,380
process of destabilization doesn t the

749
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,670
common drop of sense

750
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,430
comrade even off the United States the

751
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,540
person who takes care is already here

752
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,520
his respected citizen of the United

753
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,250
States sometimes he gets money from

754
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,330
various foundations for his legitimate

755
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,300
struggle for I don't know human rights

756
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,670
women rights kiddley prison bleep

757
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,520
whatever there are sympathetic Americans

758
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,910
who donate their money to this to be

759
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,040
like this stabilization process usually

760
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,310
leads directly to the process of crisis

761
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,300
in case of developing nations there's

762
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,370
the area where I I was actor the process

763
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:55,370
starts

764
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:06,490
when when be legitimate bodies of power

765
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,170
the social structure collapse it's it

766
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,099
cannot function anymore so instead we

767
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:15,440
have artificials body injected into

768
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,730
society such as non elected committees

769
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,050
you remember I was talking about them

770
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,470
here social workers who are not elected

771
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,270
by people media who sell who are

772
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,050
self-appointed rulers of your opinion

773
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,470
some strange groups which claim that

774
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,109
they know how to lead society forward

775
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:38,690
they don't usually only cares how to

776
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,089
collect the nation's and and from and

777
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:44,000
sell their own concocted ideology

778
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,869
mixture of religion and ideology here we

779
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:49,579
have all this art officials body

780
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,380
claiming power if the power is denied to

781
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,040
them they take it by force in case of

782
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,160
Iran for example all of a sudden we have

783
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,839
Revolutionary Committees who what what

784
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:04,280
kind of revolution there was no

785
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,990
revolution yet and yet they had two

786
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,109
committees they were taking power of

787
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,690
judgment they had they had the power of

788
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,290
execution they had the power of

789
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,329
legislation and that they had the power

790
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:21,050
of judicial all of them combined in one

791
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,000
person who is half-baked intellectual

792
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,160
sometimes graduated from Harvard

793
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,480
University or Berkeley he comes back to

794
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,970
his country and them he thinks that he

795
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,589
knows the answer to all the social

796
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:38,599
economical problem ok crisis is when

797
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,490
society cannot function any more

798
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,800
productively it collapses obviously

799
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,359
that's the word for crazy

800
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,619
so therefore the population at large is

801
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,369
looking for savior the religious groups

802
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,670
are expecting a messiah to come the

803
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:59,060
workers say we have family to feed let's

804
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,520
have a strong government maybe socialist

805
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,290
government centralized when when

806
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,260
somebody put put their employers on

807
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,560
their place and let us work we are sick

808
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,200
and tired of going to strike and this

809
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,150
over time and all that stuff we need

810
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,360
some strong man strong government and

811
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,280
leader a savior is needed population is

812
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,400
sick and tired already and here we are

813
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,580
we have a savior either a foreign nation

814
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,620
comes in or the local group of leftists

815
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,480
Marxist no matter what they call

816
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,590
themselves Sandinista a reverend or some

817
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,160
sort bishop user ever like in in

818
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,440
zimbabwe doesn't matter

819
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,220
a savior comes and says I will lead you

820
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:55,160
so we have two alternatives here civil

821
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,250
war and invasion

822
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,820
okay see how it goes Civil War we know

823
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,470
what it is Lebanon is is the best

824
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,530
example the Civil War which was

825
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,380
artificially implanted in Lebanon by

826
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,040
injection of force of PLO Palestinian

827
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,740
Liberation Organization the invasion we

828
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,120
have in many other countries like

829
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,940
Afghanistan name any East European

830
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,010
country it was invaded by the Soviet

831
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,760
Army but the result is the same the next

832
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,070
stage is normalization normalization is

833
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:46,630
a very ironic word of course it is

834
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,300
bordered from 1968 situation in

835
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,860
Czechoslovakia when the Soviet

836
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,500
propaganda and after them New York Times

837
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,020
declared the country is normalized the

838
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,910
tanks moved into Prague so there is no

839
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,160
more Prague Spring there is no more

840
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,790
violence

841
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:08,160
normal normalization at that stage the

842
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,470
self-appointed rulers of the society

843
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,990
don't need any revolution anymore they

844
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,090
don't need any radicalism anymore so

845
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,670
this is the reverse from this table

846
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,880
ization basically it is stabilizing the

847
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,140
country by force so all the sleepers and

848
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,450
activists and social workers and

849
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:32,590
liberals and homosexuals and professors

850
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,380
and Marxist Americans are being

851
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,310
eliminated physically sometimes they

852
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,770
done their job already okay they are not

853
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,600
needed anymore the new rulers need

854
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,360
stability to exploit the nation to

855
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,700
exploit the country to take advantages

856
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,270
of the victory okay so no more

857
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,880
revolution is please and that's exactly

858
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,070
what happens in number of countries you

859
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,110
remember Bangladesh this is the crisis

860
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,090
in which I was instrumental first they

861
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,350
had Mujibur Rahman in 1971 he was the

862
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,970
leader of People's Party

863
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,490
Avani League with moustache like Stalin

864
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,580
he was in Russia many times

865
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,340
in five years he was shot by his former

866
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,360
colleagues Marxists he fulfilled his

867
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,100
function in Afghanistan it happened

868
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:24,870
three times

869
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,040
first there was Karachi then there was a

870
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,080
min nowadays babrak karmal they killed

871
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,590
each other

872
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,800
successively one after another the

873
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,080
moment he fulfills his duty the first

874
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,030
one demoralized country the second

875
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,930
disturb you lies

876
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,640
the third one brought it to crisis

877
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,450
goodbye Congress babrak karmal comes

878
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,940
from Moscow and put him into the seat of

879
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,670
power same thing happened in Granada

880
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,210
recently Maurice Bishop Marxist was

881
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,580
killed by Austin what's his name general

882
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:59,500
something was also a Marxist right so no

883
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,780
more revolutions please normalization

884
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,650
now from now on no more strikes normal

885
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,650
homosexual sexual normal women lead

886
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,810
normal kid lead normally period good

887
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:23,080
solid democratic proletarian freedom now

888
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,010
to reverse this process takes enormous

889
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,420
effort when today United States had to

890
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,500
invade Grenada to reverse the process of

891
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,840
subversion some people say boy this is

892
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,300
not good it's not kosher to invade the

893
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,200
beautiful country island of Grenada well

894
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,210
why didn't you stop the process here

895
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,370
when Grenada was just approached by

896
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:51,250
leftists why not to prevent Maurice

897
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,750
Bishop to come in power in the first

898
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,260
place

899
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,840
didn't aliens want him very questionable

900
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,030
they did not was more information in the

901
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,980
first place he came to power by coup

902
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,300
d'etat himself ok no we let the

903
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,890
situation develop further and further

904
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,190
and further until the crisis and

905
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,670
normalization very soon and then the

906
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,770
United States decided to invade country

907
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,480
discovering that the the country was

908
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,550
absolutely a military base for the

909
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:21,760
Soviet Union of course it's a drastic

910
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,520
measure of course it's it's a pity that

911
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,530
marine course had to lose what 17 lines

912
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,590
very bad why not to stop

913
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,410
process before it comes to crisis or no

914
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,570
intellectuals will not let you it's

915
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,580
interference into into domestic affairs

916
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,000
they're very careful not to not not to

917
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,190
let American administration to interfere

918
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,260
in domestic affairs of Latin American

919
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,360
countries they don't mind Soviet Union

920
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,440
interfere miss affair so to reverse this

921
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,920
process from here it takes only and

922
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,090
always military force no other force on

923
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,370
earth can reverse this process at this

924
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,480
point at this point it does not take

925
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,060
military invasion of United States Army

926
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,550
it takes strong action like in Chile a

927
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,540
CIA covert involvement to prevent the

928
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,080
savior from outside to come into power

929
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,850
and to stabilize country before it

930
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,180
erupts into civil war that's country

931
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,870
before it erupts into civil war okay

932
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:32,260
support the right wing conservative

933
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,810
forces by money by crook so love doesn't

934
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,180
matter study lies and don't let the

935
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,190
crisis develop into into civil war or

936
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,400
invasion or no you're liberals mistakes

937
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,090
it's against the law the Congress will

938
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,790
not appropriate money for covert actions

939
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,450
of CIA why not

940
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,010
should we wait till the normalization

941
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,140
come and Soviet tanks landed in Los

942
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,790
Angeles Airport now at that point at the

943
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,800
point of destabilization also the

944
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,200
process could be reverse again easily

945
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,330
than this no CIA involvement at this

946
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,250
point you know what it takes here

947
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,590
restriction of some liberties for small

948
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,410
groups which are self declared enemies

949
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,220
on the society as simple as that

950
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,510
although the median liberals will tell

951
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,830
you this is against the American

952
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:31,510
Constitution how can we by force denied

953
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,250
the civil rights to criminals for

954
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,750
example it's not good okay so we allowed

955
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,210
them to okay if you allow the criminals

956
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,370
to have civil rights go on

957
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,290
in the country to the crisis this is a

958
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,500
bloodless way to do curb the rides I

959
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,660
mean not to put them in prison no no I'm

960
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,220
not talking about putting all the gays

961
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,990
from San Francisco in the concentration

962
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,400
camp do not allow them to take political

963
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,660
force do not elect them to the seats of

964
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,900
power whether it is municipality level

965
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,350
state level or federal level it has to

966
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,900
be written in the heads of American

967
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,510
voters at the person like that in the

968
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,900
city of power is an enemy do not be

969
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,020
afraid of this word it is an enemy if

970
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,710
he's not an enemy here he will be here

971
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:31,260
later on he will be shot of course okay

972
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,970
you are doing great service by denying

973
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:38,320
him a right to capitalize on his own

974
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,670
crazy ideas and become a powerful man a

975
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:47,130
man who uses the seat of power

976
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,360
restriction of certain freedoms and

977
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,300
permissiveness at that point would

978
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,650
prevent sliding into crisis and probably

979
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,910
will return the process of

980
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,120
destabilization to curb unlimited power

981
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,730
monopolistic power of trade unions here

982
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,370
at that point would say economy from

983
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:11,140
collapsing to introduce a law to stop

984
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,920
private companies of raping public

985
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,070
opinions mind income in the in the

986
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:21,850
direction of consumerism no company must

987
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,720
have a right to force you into buying

988
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,520
more unless you want it there must be a

989
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,760
law you want to advertise your your car

990
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,820
okay but not a single mentioning of

991
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:43,360
buying it now and saving money it must

992
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,580
be against the law to force people to

993
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:51,460
consume more self-restraint previously

994
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,610
before this process started the

995
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,420
self-restraint

996
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,380
was a business of church religion

997
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,030
because our preaches the fathers of

998
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:04,150
church would tell us material values are

999
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,630
good but it's not the prime function of

1000
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,970
human being because you have to live

1001
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:13,000
with something obviously the design for

1002
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,370
our life is not to consume more the

1003
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:19,990
audience must be something greater if

1004
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,960
such a complicated instrument this human

1005
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,960
body was created obviously there must be

1006
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,650
some higher purpose for that and it's

1007
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,260
very easy to avoid destabilization by

1008
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,730
denying the greedy companies one little

1009
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,430
freedom one little Liberty forcing you

1010
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:42,460
into turning yourself into professor's

1011
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,440
of unwanted products and goods they turn

1012
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,330
you into machines like a the worm who

1013
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:57,880
that is Inlet and outlet and how long an

1014
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,090
average appliance lost this day less

1015
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:06,940
than a year why where's workmanship we

1016
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,280
want you to buy them ok this

1017
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,800
stabilization process could be easily

1018
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:16,510
overcome if as I say the society by its

1019
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,610
own will or after persuasion by the

1020
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,530
leaders will come to the idea of

1021
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:25,990
self-restraint it's so hard we want to

1022
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,530
consume more but you have to unless you

1023
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,230
will come to this stage when as we say

1024
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,360
in Russia if the heart of desert ever

1025
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,430
becomes the communist state they'll be

1026
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:41,470
sure to send you have to curb your

1027
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,599
[Laughter]

1028
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:48,890
you have to you have to curb your

1029
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,619
expectations at this point before it's

1030
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:55,339
too late but no we don't want to do it

1031
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:58,920
demo realization process again it's the

1032
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,329
easiest thing to reverse first of all by

1033
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:06,089
restricting import of propaganda the

1034
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:10,460
easiest thing to do unlimited

1035
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,529
unrestrained import of Soviet literature

1036
00:55:13,529 --> 00:55:17,839
so that journalists giving solid

1037
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,369
propaganda and ideological agitators

1038
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:24,119
equal time on American TV network it has

1039
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:25,349
to be stopped

1040
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,410
and it's easy they won't they won't be

1041
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,869
offended minded as a matter of fact they

1042
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:35,010
will respect American War but then my

1043
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,660
former colleague Vladimir Posner

1044
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,029
appears on Nightline and Ted Koppel

1045
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:40,740
asking well regime and what do you think

1046
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,650
about this and what can he think he is

1047
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,839
an instrument of propaganda he thinks

1048
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,789
what what what comrade Andropov tells me

1049
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:51,569
to think he's just a nice articulate

1050
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:53,339
mouthpiece of the Soviet era a

1051
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:56,339
submersion system and Ted Koppel makes

1052
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:59,250
you believe that my friend Vladimir

1053
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,509
Posner things

1054
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,310
the process of dimerization may not have

1055
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:16,020
started at all if at that point the

1056
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,720
country which is a recipient of

1057
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,040
subversion actively not violently but

1058
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,000
actively prevents importation of foreign

1059
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,210
ideology

1060
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,450
I don't want America to follow the

1061
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,970
pattern of ancient Japan you don't have

1062
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,740
to shoot every foreigner when it

1063
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,200
approaches the sacred borders of the

1064
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,230
United States but when he offers you a

1065
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,840
junk in the disguise of very shiny

1066
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,800
something you have to tell him no we

1067
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,370
have our own junk

1068
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:55,940
[Laughter]

1069
00:56:56,089 --> 00:57:00,829
if at that point the society is strong

1070
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:05,779
brave and conscientious enough to stop

1071
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:09,999
importation of ideas which are foreign

1072
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:13,729
then the whole chain of events could be

1073
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:15,189
prevented

1074
00:57:15,189 --> 00:57:18,469
recently identify Lapine's and I was

1075
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:22,599
shocked how in big cities like Manila

1076
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:26,469
children listened to deafening music a

1077
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:30,739
melodious nation with long traditions of

1078
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:35,059
good nice ethnic music introduced by

1079
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:38,269
Spanish long time ago maybe two

1080
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:39,859
centuries three centuries ago I don't

1081
00:57:39,859 --> 00:57:42,170
remember all of a sudden listen to

1082
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:46,309
musical garbage blasting their radios at

1083
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:51,099
full blast at the full volume why in

1084
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:55,160
India I spent many years watching the

1085
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,579
reactions of Indians walking out of

1086
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,609
movie theaters after seeing Hollywood

1087
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:06,229
production they couldn't figure out why

1088
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:08,479
Americans are so wasteful they smash

1089
00:58:08,479 --> 00:58:11,179
their cars their shiny cars every 5

1090
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:13,849
minutes how come they should each other

1091
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:18,469
for half million dollars is it true that

1092
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:20,449
they are so sex sex

1093
00:58:20,449 --> 00:58:24,380
but I mean obsessed with sex can you

1094
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,679
imagine showing a movie where each 5

1095
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:30,229
minutes there is copulation on the

1096
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:32,689
screen so I country like India with long

1097
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:36,380
traditions tradition of of respect to

1098
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:42,309
this private matters for to Pakistan and

1099
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,719
United States expect these people to

1100
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,829
respect you no way oh yes they will see

1101
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,569
the movie they'll pay 5 rupees to see

1102
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,699
that garbage but they walk out and will

1103
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:56,269
tell their kids don't respect Americans

1104
00:58:56,269 --> 00:59:00,709
don't be like Americans see so the

1105
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:04,489
process of dimerization could be stopped

1106
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:08,689
right here both as an expert and as an

1107
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:09,650
input

1108
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:13,520
and that takes one step one very

1109
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,950
important thing to do you don't have to

1110
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:18,410
expel all the KGB agents from Washington

1111
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:22,099
DC the most difficult and at the same

1112
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,650
time the simplest answer to the

1113
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,890
subversion is to start it here and even

1114
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:34,160
before by bringing back the society to

1115
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,069
religion something that you cannot touch

1116
00:59:37,069 --> 00:59:39,859
and eat and put on yourself but

1117
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:42,079
something that rules society and makes

1118
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,680
it move and preserve it a soviet

1119
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,079
scientist Schaffer a leech who has

1120
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,119
nothing to do with religion he is a

1121
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,079
computer scientist did a very intensive

1122
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,599
research on the history of socialist

1123
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:59,750
countries he call socialist or communist

1124
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,460
in any country with a centralized

1125
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,460
economy and the pyramidal style of power

1126
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,900
structure and he discovered actually he

1127
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,640
didn't discover it he just brought to

1128
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,829
attention of his readers the

1129
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:16,990
civilizations like mohenjo-daro in the

1130
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:21,500
river hindus area like egypt like maya

1131
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,390
Incas like below but Babylonian culture

1132
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,220
collapsed and disappeared from the

1133
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,150
surface of the moment they lost religion

1134
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,380
as simple as that they disintegrated

1135
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,119
nobody remembers about them anymore

1136
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:45,650
well distantly so the ideas are moving

1137
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:49,549
society and keeping mankind as a society

1138
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:53,450
of human beings intelligent moral agents

1139
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:59,450
of God the facts the truth the exact

1140
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,750
knowledge may not all the sophisticated

1141
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,700
technology and computers will not

1142
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,250
prevent society from disintegrating and

1143
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:11,210
eventually dying out have you ever met a

1144
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,609
person who would sacrifice his life

1145
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:19,369
freedom for the truth like that this is

1146
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:20,750
truth

1147
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,940
I never met the person who said this is

1148
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:29,119
truth and I'm ready to shoot me to

1149
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:34,569
defend the truth right but millions

1150
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:38,200
sacrificed their life freedom comfort

1151
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:46,010
everything for things like God like

1152
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:50,540
Jesus Christ it's a known some markers

1153
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,200
in the Soviet concentration camp died

1154
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,829
and they died in peace unlike those who

1155
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:59,990
shouted long live Stalin knowing

1156
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,240
perfectly well that we may not live

1157
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:08,660
wrong something which is something which

1158
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:13,970
is not material moves society and helps

1159
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:17,480
it to survive and they are the way

1160
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,819
around the moment we turn into two by

1161
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:23,270
two is four and make it a guiding

1162
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:26,380
principle of our life our existence we

1163
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:31,010
die even though this is true and this we

1164
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,490
cannot prove when we can feel and have

1165
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:37,520
faith in it so the answer to ideological

1166
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,819
subversion strangely enough is very

1167
01:02:40,819 --> 01:02:43,250
simple you don't have to shoot people

1168
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:47,050
you don't have to end missiles and

1169
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,970
Pershing's and cruise missiles that and

1170
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:53,359
drop of headquarters you simply have to

1171
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:57,740
have faith and prevent suppression in

1172
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,589
other words not to be a victim of

1173
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:04,040
subversion don't try to be a person who

1174
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,250
in judo is trying to smash your enemy

1175
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,569
and being caught by your hand don't

1176
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:14,750
strike like that strike with the power

1177
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,440
of spirit and moral superiority

1178
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,880
if you don't have the power it's high

1179
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,609
time to develop it and that's the only

1180
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:24,819
answer

1181
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:30,080
[Applause]

1182
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:56,269
[Applause]
