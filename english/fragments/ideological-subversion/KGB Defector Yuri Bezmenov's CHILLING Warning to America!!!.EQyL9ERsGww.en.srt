1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,920
what you're about to see is an interview

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,940
from the year ironically

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,039
1984. it involves KGB Defector Yuri

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,559
besminoff and his revelation of what he

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,259
called the Soviet subversion Model A

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,000
four-point Plan by which the Soviet

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,039
Union sought to subvert the United

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,619
States from within I think I can assure

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,060
you that you're going to find what he

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,400
says chilling and how it seems to be

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,599
playing out right before our very eyes

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
Mr bezmianov was born in 1939 in a

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,320
suburb of Moscow he was the son of a

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,260
high-ranking Soviet army officer he was

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,360
educated in the elite schools inside the

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,399
Soviet Union and became an expert in

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,579
Indian culture and Indian languages

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,920
he had an outstanding career with novice

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,620
which was the pr and still is I should

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,620
say the Press arm or the Press agency of

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,300
the Soviet Union it turns out that this

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,539
is also a front for the KGB

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,420
he escaped to the West in 1970 after

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,219
becoming totally disgusted with the

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,379
Soviet system and he did this at Great

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,119
risk to his life

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,680
he certainly is one of the world's

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
outstanding experts on the subject of

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,420
Soviet propaganda and disinformation and

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,100
active measures

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,320
well you spoke several times before

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,840
about ideological subversion that is a

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,180
phrase that I'm afraid some Americans

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,600
don't fully understand when the Soviets

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
used the phrase ideological subversion

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,040
what do they mean by ideological

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,100
subversion is is the slow process

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,619
which we call either ideological

39
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,939
subversion or active measures active in

40
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,579
the language of the KGB or psychological

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,520
warfare what it basically means is to

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,340
change the perception of reality of

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,380
every American

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,020
to such an extent that despite of the

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,060
abundance of information

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,460
no one is able to come to sensible

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,899
conclusions

48
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,479
in the interests of Defending themselves

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,759
their families their community and their

50
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,020
country

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,000
all right I just want to make sure we

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,818
have that definition really set in front

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,679
of us here as he takes us through the

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,459
process big picture besminoff is making

55
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,520
the point that much of the work of the

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,560
KGB had literally nothing to do with the

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,860
James Bond like glamors of Espionage and

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,739
Intrigue instead much of it involved a

59
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,440
very slow very patient but very

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,200
deliberate process of undermining the

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,599
stability of a rival Nation through what

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,180
they called ideological subversion and

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,760
here's how we Define that quote

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,879
what it basically means is to change the

65
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,860
perception of reality of every American

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,739
to such an extent that despite the

67
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,620
abundance of information no one is able

68
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,800
to come to sensible conclusions in the

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,840
interest of Defending themselves their

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,420
families their community and their

71
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,260
country

72
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,280
I gotta say when I first heard that

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,319
sometime back I asked myself is he

74
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,860
defining or is he describing

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,620
because what he just said there could

76
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,739
easily be a description of many in our

77
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,319
society today we have we have an entire

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
class of people whose perception

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
realities quite literally beyond the

80
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,640
sensible beyond the biological beyond

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,099
the national they're increasingly

82
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,680
pushing a vision of reality that

83
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,019
seemingly makes no sense even the people

84
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,620
on the left like Bill Maher and yet

85
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,180
everyone's scared to death to confront

86
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,879
them on it to stand up to this lest you

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,299
be excommunicated canceled

88
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,440
it's a great brainwashing process which

89
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,080
goes very slow and it's divided in in

90
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,420
four basic stages

91
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,480
uh the first one being demoralization it

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,819
takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize

93
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,640
the nation why that many years because

94
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,680
this is the minimum number of years

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,860
which requires to educate one generation

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,420
of students

97
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,319
in the country of of your enemy exposed

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,319
to the ideology of the enemy in other

99
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,139
words Marx's leninism ideology is being

100
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,418
pumped into the soft heads of of at

101
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,798
least three generations of American

102
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,139
students without being challenged or

103
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,840
counterbalanced by the basic values of

104
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,840
americanism American patriotism

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,419
the demoralization process in the United

106
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,180
States is basically completed already

107
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,020
for the last 25 years actually it's over

108
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,419
fulfilled because demoralization now

109
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,360
reaches such areas where previously not

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,699
even comrade and drop off and on all his

111
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,000
experts would would even dream of such a

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,300
tremendous success most of it is done by

113
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,940
Americans to Americans thanks to lack of

114
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,900
moral standards as I mentioned before

115
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,060
exposure to True information does not

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,680
matter anymore

117
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,340
a person who was demoralized is unable

118
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,860
to assess true information the facts

119
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,000
tell nothing to him even if I shower him

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,979
with information with with authentic

121
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,740
proof with documents with pictures

122
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,139
even if I take him by force to the

123
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,000
Soviet Union and show him concentration

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,300
camp he will refuse to believe it until

125
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,180
he he is going to receive a kick in the

126
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,940
in his fat bottom when a military boat

127
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,220
crashes his balls then he will

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,139
understand but not before that that's

129
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,639
the tragic of the situation of

130
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,280
demoralization when he talked about this

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,919
first stage of demoralization I could

132
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,560
not help but think of the Frankfurt

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,360
School which was a group of European

134
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,160
academics who came over to the United

135
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
States to escape Hitler but brought

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,919
their cultural Marxist ideas to the

137
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,780
American University and for various

138
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,500
reasons the ideas flourished in colleges

139
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,479
Across the Nation and at the heart of

140
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,419
the Frankfurt school's ideology is this

141
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,639
notion of critical theory which teaches

142
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,979
students how to supposedly expose

143
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,039
everything in our culture from our

144
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,780
politics to our economics from our

145
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,120
entertainment to our fashion you name it

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,360
as inherently racist sexist and

147
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,460
homophobic and eventually critical

148
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,860
theory entered into our K-12 classrooms

149
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,020
through the broader notion of what's

150
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,960
called critical pedagogy from which we

151
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,300
get what's called CRT or critical race

152
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,720
Theory but what besminoff is saying here

153
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,940
is that all of that was highly

154
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,520
deliberate it wasn't simply an academic

155
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,440
development in the free exchange of

156
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,560
ideas it was more like a virus that was

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,840
deliberately injected into our national

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,419
culture and radically weakened our

159
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,940
social immune system and as he put it it

160
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,400
was more effective than any KGB agent

161
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,620
could have imagined and he would go on

162
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,360
to say that that's going to take a new

163
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,060
generation of Americans to rise up and

164
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,100
push back against this neo-marxas

165
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,340
ideological filth that so permeated the

166
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,680
last couple of generations

167
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,979
the next stage is destabilization this

168
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,800
time subverter does not care about your

169
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,360
ideas and the patterns of your

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,220
consumption whether you eat junk food

171
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,139
and get fat and flub it doesn't matter

172
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,960
anymore this time and it takes only from

173
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,880
two to five years to destabilize the

174
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,180
nation uh it's what what matters is

175
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,940
Essentials economy Foreign Relations

176
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,280
defense systems

177
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
and you can see it quite clearly that in

178
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,020
some areas in such sensitive areas is

179
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,740
defense and economy the influence of

180
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,539
marxist leninist ideas in the United

181
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,599
States is absolutely fantastic I could

182
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,460
never believe it 14 years ago when I

183
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,099
landed in this part of the world that

184
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,620
the process will go that fast

185
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,120
well it's only gone downhill from there

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,800
won't cancel culture is completely

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,919
infected our mainstream economy and

188
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,340
unfortunately our military and I

189
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,199
personally find it offensive

190
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,419
that we are accusing the United States

191
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,280
military our General Offices our

192
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,780
commissioned non-commissioned officers

193
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,759
of being quote woke or something else

194
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,440
because we're studying some theories

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
that are out there that was started at

196
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,979
Harvard Law School years ago and it

197
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,840
proposed that there were laws in the

198
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,060
United States anti-bellum laws prior to

199
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,940
the Civil War that led to a power

200
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
differential with African Americans that

201
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,120
were three quarters of a human being

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,099
when this country was formed and then we

203
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,599
had a civil war and emancipation proper

204
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,339
probation to change it and we brought it

205
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,260
up to the Civil Rights Act in 1964 took

206
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,299
another 100 years to change that so look

207
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,120
it I do want to know yeah that's woke

208
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,820

bring a country to the verge of Crisis

236
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,260
you can see it in in Central America now

237
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,300
and after crisis with a violent change

238
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,480
of power structure and economy you have

239
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,300
so-called the period of normalization it

240
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,060
may last indefinitely normalization is a

241
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,220
cynical expression borrowed from Soviet

242
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,380
propaganda when the Soviet tanks moved

243
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,899
into Czechoslovakia in 68 comrade

244
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,420
breshner said now the situation in

245
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,000
brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized

246
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,860
this is what will happen in the United

247
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,959
States if you allow all these Schmucks

248
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,540
to bring the country to crisis

249
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
to promise people all kind of goodies

250
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,060
and the paradise on Earth to to

251
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,360
destabilize your economy to eliminate

252
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,339
the principle of free market competition

253
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,580
and to put a big brother government

254
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,360
in Washington DC with the benevolent

255
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,300
dictators Like Walter Mondale who will

256
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,339
promise lots of things never mind

257
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,320
whether the promises are fulfillable or

258
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,779
not yeah again as I hear him describe

259
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,240
this crisis stage I just couldn't help

260
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,220
but think of where we are today with the

261
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,680
Bumble and binding Administration I mean

262
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,200
unprecedented inflation surging gas

263
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,380
prices a looming recession baby formula

264
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,079
shortages supply chain interruptions I

265
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,720
need another hand border implosion of

266
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,300
violent crime epidemic defunding the

267
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,000
police woke school boards Global

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,720
pandemics Mass lockdowns

269
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,820
unconstitutional vax mandates and then

270
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,880
after that normalization this crisis

271
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,519
condition ends up being The New Normal

272
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,279
a fully destabilized nation is now the

273
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
new normal and the enemy has been

274
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
thwarted from within I mean it's pretty

275
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,300
terrifying stuff but again the good news

276
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,540
is that besmenoff believed that we were

277
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,339
just one generation away from American

278
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,660
renewal

279
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,600
and everywhere we look that's exactly

280
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,420
what we're seeing there's nothing short

281
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,300
of a massive Grassroots backlash against

282
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,940
woke cultural Marxism and it's just the

283
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,459
beginning we will take our nation back

284
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,620
and we will go through a conservative

285
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,800
Renaissance and while people like Yuri

286
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
besminoff

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,680
