1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,520
subversion is the term if if you look in

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,319
in a dictionary or criminal code to that

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,839
matter

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,200
usually is ex is explained as a part

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
of activity to destroy

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,199
things like religion government system

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
political economical system of a country

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
and usually it's linked to espionage and

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
such romantic things as blowing up

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,640
bridges

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,760
side tracking trains

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
clock and dagger activity in hollywood

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,399
style

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,760
when what i'm going to talk about now

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,079
has

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,200
absolutely nothing to do with the cliche

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
of espionage or kgb activity of

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
collecting information

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
so the greatest mistake or mis

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
misconception i think is that

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
whenever we are talking about kgb for

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,559
some strange reason

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,039
uh starting from hollywood movie makers

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
to professors of political science

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,200
and quote-unquote experts on soviet

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,159
affairs or

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
cremonologists as they call themselves

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
they think that

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
the most desirable thing for andropov

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,159
and the whole kgb

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
is to steal blueprints of some

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,400
supersonic jet

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
bring it back to soviet union and

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
sell it to the soviet military

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,920
industrial complex

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
it's only partly true if if we take

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,280
the whole time money

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,720
and manpower that the soviet union

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
and kgb in particular spends

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
outside of ussr border we will discover

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
of course there are no official

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
statistics unlike with cia or fbi

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,880
but the espionage as such

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,119
occupies only 10 to 15

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
of money time and manpower

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
15

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
of the activity kgb the rest

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,879
85 is always

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,720
subversion and unlike a dictionary

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,599
of english oxford dictionary subversion

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,120
in soviet terminology

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
means always a destructive aggressive

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,879
activity

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,800
aimed to destroy the country

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
nation or geographical area of your

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
enemy

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
so there's no romantics in there

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
absolutely no blowing up bridges no

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
microfilms in coca-cola cans

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,519
nothing of that sort no james bond

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,280
nonsense

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
it's most of the this activity is overt

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,319
legitimate and easily

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
observable if you give yourself time and

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,000
trouble to observe

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,920
it but according to the law

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
and and law enforcement systems of the

68
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,080
western civilization it's not a crime

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,400
exactly because of misconception

70
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,159
manipulation of terms

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
we think that subverter is a person who

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
is going to blow up

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,280
our beautiful bridges no

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
subverter is a student who come for

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
exchange a diplomat

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,159
an actor an artist a journalist like

77
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,040
myself

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,159
was 10 years ago

79
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,280
now subversion

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
is an activity which

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
is a two-way traffic

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
you cannot subvert an enemy which

83
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
doesn't want to be subverted

84
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
if you know history of japan for example

85
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,159
before 20th century japan was a closed

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,599
society

87
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
the moment a foreign boat comes to the

88
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
shores of japan

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
the imperial japanese army politely tell

90
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
them to get lost

91
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
and if american salesman comes to the

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
shore of japan

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
let's say 60 or 70 years from now back

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
and says oh i have a very beautiful

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
vacuum cleaner for you

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
you know with the good financing please

97
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
leave us we don't need your vacuum

98
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,000
cleaner

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
if they don't leave they shoot them

100
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
to preserve their culture ideology

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
traditions

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,600
values impact

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
you were not able to subvert japan

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
you cannot subvert soviet union because

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
the borders are closed

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
the media is censored by the government

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
the population is controlled by the kgb

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
and internal police with all the

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
beautiful glossy pictures of time

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,440
magazine

111
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
and magazine america which is published

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
by by the

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
uh american embassy in moscow you cannot

114
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
subvert soviet citizens because the

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
magazine never reaches

116
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
soviet citizens it's collected from the

117
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,880
new stamps and thrown to garbage can

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,759
subversion can be only successful when

119
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,800
the

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,240
initiator the actor the act the agent of

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
subversion

122
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,919
has a responsive target

123
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
it's a two-way traffic united states

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
is a receptive target of subversion

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
there is no response similar to that one

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,400
from united states to the soviet union

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
it stops halfway somewhere it never

128
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
reaches here

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,039
the theory of subversion goes all the

130
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,919
way back

131
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,360
2 500 years ago

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
the first human being who formulated

133
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
the tactics of subversion was a chinese

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
philosopher

135
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,320
by the name of sunset

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,240
to 3500 years bc

137
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
it was an advisor for several imperial

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,600
courts in

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
ancient china and he said

140
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
after long meditation that

141
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,360
to implement foreign to implement

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
state policy in a warlike manner

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
it's the most counterproductive barbaric

144
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
and inefficient to fight on a

145
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,319
battlefield

146
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
you know that war is continuation of

147
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
state policy right so if you want

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,919
successfully to implement your state

149
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,440
policy

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
and you start fighting this is the most

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
idiotic way to do it

152
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,720
the highest arc of warfare is not

153
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,319
to fight at all

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
but to subvert anything of value in the

155
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
country of your enemy

156
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
until such time that the perception of

157
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
reality of your enemy

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
is screwed up to such an extent that he

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
does not perceive you as an enemy

160
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
and that your system your civilization

161
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
and your for ambitions

162
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,479
look to your enemy as an alternative

163
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,520
if not desirable then at least visible

164
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,039
better red than dead

165
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
that's the ultimate purpose the final

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
stage of subversion after which you can

167
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
simply take your enemy without a single

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
shot being fired

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
if the subversion is successful this is

170
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
basically what subversion means

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
as you see not the single mentioning of

172
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,400
blowing up bridges of course sunset

173
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,759
didn't know about

174
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
blowing up bridges maybe there were not

175
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,560
that many bridges at that time

176
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
but the basics

177
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,599
of subversion is being taught to every

178
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,479
student

179
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
of kgb school in ussr and to offices of

180
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
military academies

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,639
i'm not sure if the same author is

182
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,000
included in the

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
list of breeding for american officers

184
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
to say nothing about ordinary students

185
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
of political science

186
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
i had difficulty to find the translation

187
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,280
of sunset

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,639
in in the library of a university

189
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,280
in toronto and later on here in los

190
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
angeles

191
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
but it's a it's a book which is not

192
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,120
available it is forced to every student

193
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,559
in ussr every student who is who is

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,200
taught to be dealing further in in his

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,760
future

196
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
career with foreigners

197
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,360
what subversion is basically it consists

198
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
of four

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
periods time wise

200
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,560
if we start from here and go this way

201
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
time right this is the beginning point

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
the first stage of subversion

203
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,320
is the process which is called basically

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,279
demoralization

205
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:08,080
says for itself what it is

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
it takes from um

207
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,959
say 15 to 20 years

208
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,399
to demoralize a society

209
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,200
why why 15 or 20 years this is the time

210
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,640
sufficient to educate one generation

211
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
of students or children one generation

212
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,440
one lifetime span of a person a human

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
being

214
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
which is dedicated to study to shaping

215
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,200
up

216
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
the outlook ideology personality

217
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
no more no less usually it takes from 15

218
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,560
to 20 years

219
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
what it includes it includes

220
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
influencing or by various matters

221
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
infiltration

222
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,680
uh propaganda methods direct contacts

223
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
doesn't really matter

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
i will describe them later of various

225
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,360
areas where public opinion is formulated

226
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,800
or shaped religion

227
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,200
educational system social life

228
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
administration law enforcement system

229
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,360
military of course and

230
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
labor and employer relations

231
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,839
economy okay five areas

232
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
uh i will not write them down because

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
will not have enough space

234
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
some sometimes when i describe all the

235
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
methods

236
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
uh students ask me question are you sure

237
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,480
this

238
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
is the result of the soviet influence

239
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
not necessarily

240
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
you see the tactic of subversion about

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
which i'm talking

242
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
is similar to the martial art the

243
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,519
japanese martial art

244
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,200
if you're if some of you familiar with

245
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
that tactic probably you will remember

246
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,519
that if

247
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,760
an enemy is bigger and heavier than

248
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,800
yourself

249
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
it would be very painful to resist his

250
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,480
direct

251
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,000
strike if a heavier person wants to

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
strike me in the face

253
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
it would be very naive and

254
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
counterproductive to stop his blow

255
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,200
the chinese and japanese judo

256
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
art tells us what to do first to avoid

257
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,680
the strike

258
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,959
then to grab the fist and continue his

259
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
movement

260
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
in the direction where it was before

261
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,240
right until the enemy crashes in the

262
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
wall

263
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
you see so what happens here

264
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,399
the target country obviously does

265
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,760
something wrong

266
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,639
if it's a free democratic society there

267
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,839
are many different movements within the

268
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,440
society

269
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
that obviously in every society

270
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
there are people who are against this

271
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
society they may be simple criminals

272
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,639
ideologically in disagreement with

273
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,440
with the state policy conscientious

274
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,240
enemies

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
simply psychotic personalities who are

276
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
against anything

277
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
right and finally they're a small group

278
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,399
of agents of a foreign

279
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,480
nation bought subverted

280
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,160
recruited right the moment

281
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,120
all these movements will be directed in

282
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,240
one direction

283
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
right this is the time to catch that

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,920
movement

285
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,760
and to continue it until the movement

286
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
forces the whole society into collapse

287
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
into crisis right

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,680
so that's exactly the martial art tactic

289
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
we don't stop an enemy we let him go

290
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
we help him to go in the direction we

291
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
want them to go

292
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,360
okay so on the stage of demoralization

293
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
obviously there are tendencies in each

294
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,560
society in each country which are going

295
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
to opposite direction from the basic

296
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,560
moral values and principles

297
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,600
to take advantage of these movements to

298
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,360
capitalize on them

299
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
is the main purpose of the originator of

300
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,200
subversion

301
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
so we have religion we have education

302
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,639
we have social life we have power

303
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,920
structure

304
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
we have labor relations unions and

305
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
finally we have

306
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,600
law and order one two three four five

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
six

308
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
okay these are the areas of application

309
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
of subversion

310
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
what it means exactly in case of

311
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,079
religion

312
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
destroy it ridicule it

313
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,279
replace it with various sex cults

314
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,160
which bring people's attention faith

315
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
whether it is naive primitive doesn't

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,120
really matter

317
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
as long as the basically accepted

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
religious dogma is being slowly eroded

319
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,079
and taken away from the supreme purpose

320
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,399
of religion to keep people

321
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,959
in touch with with the supreme being

322
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
that serves the purpose

323
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
therefore replaced accepted respected

324
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
religious organizations with fake

325
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
organizations

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
distract people attention from the real

327
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,440
faith

328
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,920
and attract them to various different

329
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
faiths

330
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,639
education distract them from learning

331
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
something which is constructive

332
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,320
pragmatic

333
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
efficient instead of mathematics physics

334
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
foreign languages

335
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,160
chemistry teach them history of urban

336
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,839
warfare

337
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,680
natural food uh

338
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,000
home economy your sexuality

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
anything as long as it takes you away

340
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
okay uh social life

341
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
replace traditionally established

342
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
institutions

343
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
and organizations with fake

344
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
organizations

345
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,560
take away the initiative from people

346
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,399
take away the responsibility

347
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,320
from naturally established links between

348
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
individuals group of individuals and

349
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,120
society at large

350
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
and replace them with artificially

351
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
bureaucratically controlled

352
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
bodies instead of social

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,040
life and friendship between neighbors

354
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
establish social workers

355
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
institutions the people who are on

356
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
payroll of whom

357
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
society no bureaucracy the main concern

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
of social workers is not your family not

359
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
you not social relations between groups

360
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,040
of people

361
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,399
the main concern is to get the paycheck

362
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,959
from the government what will be the

363
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,639
result of their social work doesn't

364
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,000
really matter

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
they can develop all kind of concepts

366
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,880
to show them to show to the government

367
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,120
and to the people that they're used for

368
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,320
okay away from the natural links

369
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
power structure okay the natural

370
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
bodies of administration which are

371
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,440
traditionally either elected by

372
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
by people at large or appointed by

373
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
elected leaders of society

374
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
are being actively substituted by

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
artificial bodies

376
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
the bodies of people groups of people

377
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
whom nobody elected

378
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,759
never as a matter of fact most of the

379
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,040
people

380
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,959
don't like them at all and yet they

381
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
exist

382
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
one of the such group is media who

383
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,519
elected them

384
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
how come how come they they face

385
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
they have so much power almost

386
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,519
monopolistic power on your mind

387
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,160
they can rape your mind but who elected

388
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,279
them how come

389
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,600
they are they have a nerve to decide

390
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
what is good and what is bad for

391
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
for the elected by you president and his

392
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
administration

393
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
who the hell are they

394
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,359
who was hated by the liberal left called

395
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,000
them

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,799
a bunch of enfield snobs and that's

397
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,000
exactly what they are

398
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,599
they think they know they don't say

399
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,119
the level of mediocracy in a big

400
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,959
establishment like new york times los

401
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:25,839
angeles time

402
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
major television network you don't have

403
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
to be excellent journalist

404
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
you have to be exactly a mediocre

405
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
journalist that's

406
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
easier to survive there's no competition

407
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
anymore you have your

408
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
good nice income 100 000

409
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,039
a year that's it whether you're better

410
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,799
or worse doesn't really matter anymore

411
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,240
as soon as you're smiling

412
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,360
to the camera and do your job

413
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,679
that's it no more no more competition

414
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,799
power structure slowly

415
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
is eroded by the bodies and groups of

416
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
people who

417
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
do not have neither qualification nor

418
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
the will of people

419
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,640
to keep them in power and yet they do

420
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,559
have power

421
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,039
okay together with that there is another

422
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,640
process

423
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
law enforcement law and order uh

424
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,400
organization and structure is being

425
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,919
eroded

426
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
for the last 20 25 years you you if you

427
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,600
see

428
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
old movies and new movies you can see

429
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
that in new movies

430
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,320
a policeman an officer of the united

431
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,840
states army looks

432
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
dumb angry psychotic paranoid

433
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
a criminal looks nice kind of well

434
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,720
he smokes hash and shoots the whatever

435
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,600
drug but basically he's a nice human

436
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,559
being

437
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
he's creative and he's unproductive only

438
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,160
because society oppresses him

439
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,799
whereby a general pentagon is always by

440
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,520
definition

441
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
a dumb a war maniac a policeman is a

442
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,320
big rude policeman he abuses his power

443
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
you know a generality generalization

444
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
like that

445
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
the hatred the mistrust to the people

446
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,640
who supposed to protect you

447
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,880
and enforce law and order moral

448
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
relativity

449
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
the angel of warner process lasted two

450
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,360
years in los angeles

451
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
relativity the angel of warner process

452
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,559
lasted two years in los angeles

453
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
and yet there are still some lawyers who

454
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
say look he's a nice character as a

455
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,760
matter of fact

456
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
there was some witness who said also a

457
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,440
criminal who said

458
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
well he's a nice guy i ask him one day

459
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,840
to burn a house of my enemy and he

460
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,480
wouldn't do it

461
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,160
[Laughter]

462
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,360
a slow substitution of basic moral

463
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
principles

464
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
whereby a criminal is not a criminal

465
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,480
actually

466
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,679
he's a defendant even if his guilt is

467
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,200
proven

468
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,880
there is still a doubt to kill or not to

469
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
kill to be or not to be

470
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,679
thai shall not kill yes but

471
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,559
this line may not necessarily be

472
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,559
applicable to a murderer

473
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
but i shall not murder that should be

474
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
the the presumption not not that i shall

475
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,159
not kill

476
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,240
okay labor relations at this stage

477
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,640
within 15 to 20 years we destroy

478
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,400
the traditionally established links of

479
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,120
bargaining

480
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,720
between employer and employee

481
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,480
the classical marxist leninist theory of

482
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
natural exchange of goods

483
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,600
a person a has five sacks of grain and

484
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,480
person b

485
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
has five pairs of shoes and the natural

486
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,280
exchange without

487
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,320
money is when they bargain between each

488
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,679
other

489
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,360
and only with the introduction of the

490
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,320
third four c

491
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
an entirely third foreign stranger who

492
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
says no don't give him five sacks of

493
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
drink give it to me

494
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,760
and you give me your five pairs of shoes

495
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,720
and i will distribute it accordingly

496
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
so the economy will go this

497
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
is the death of natural exchange and

498
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
that death of natural bargaining

499
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,679
well trade unions were established 100

500
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,880
years ago

501
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,039
the objective was to improve working

502
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,280
conditions and to protect the rights of

503
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
workers

504
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,720
from those employers who were abusing

505
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,880
their their right because they had more

506
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
money

507
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,280
objectively at that time initially the

508
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,039
trade union movement did work

509
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,240
what we see now is that the bargaining

510
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,760
process is no longer resulting into

511
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,960
in the compromise which is leading

512
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
objectively to

513
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,039
betterment of working conditions and

514
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,080
increase of salary what we see

515
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,200
is that after each prolonged strike the

516
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,919
workers

517
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
lose even if they have 10 increase of

518
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,240
their salaries

519
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
they cannot catch up due to inflation

520
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
and due to missed time

521
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,280
more than that millions of people suffer

522
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
from that strike

523
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,559
because economy now is interdependent

524
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,760
it's intertwined like one body

525
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,480
if previously still workers say 100

526
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,120
years ago

527
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
could strike and nobody would suffer now

528
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
it's impossible anymore

529
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,720
if a garbage collector strikes today the

530
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
rest of the multi-million city is

531
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,919
stinking

532
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,280
i mean that there's no more service

533
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,039
in quebec for example we had the

534
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
electricians who were on strike

535
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,320
in the middle of winter you can freeze

536
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,280
your bottom

537
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,240
and they still weren't strike did they

538
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,880
catch up with the celery no they lost

539
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
who benefited the leaders of trade union

540
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
what is the motivation for strike

541
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
improving improving of a worker's

542
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,360
condition

543
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,360
no obviously it's not then what is it

544
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,520
ideology to prove to these capitalists

545
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,919
and the obedient horde of workers like

546
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,760
sheep follow these people and they

547
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,679
cannot disobey why

548
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,600
because if they do you know what happens

549
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
to them tickets

550
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,880
murders shooting truck drivers by

551
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,919
picketers in montreal for example i saw

552
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,200
with my own eyes when i was

553
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,720
correspondent of cbc

554
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
international canadian broadcasting

555
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
calculation when the workers of

556
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,919
aircraft factory destroyed computers and

557
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,039
and the equipment in the factory and

558
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:43,600
they

559
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,840
the administration employed strike

560
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,720
breakers

561
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
their cars were turned upside down and

562
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,039
burned

563
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,279
their houses were burned their kids were

564
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,799
intimidated and some

565
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,960
victims were there of that you can be

566
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
sure

567
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,279
why to improve conditions of workers

568
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,640
no ideology okay so

569
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,840
this is what happens basically

570
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
it may or may not happen without the

571
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,919
help of the soviet union

572
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,360
but the natural tendencies are being

573
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,120
greatly taken advantage of and

574
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,360
capitalized by the soviet propaganda

575
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,840
systems how

576
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
whenever trade union strikes we have

577
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,799
influx of propaganda mass media

578
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,960
ideological dissemination

579
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,440
the workers right and we repeat it like

580
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,000

only two dollars no i was made to

598
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,000
believe by media

599
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,559
by business by advertising agencies that

600
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,120
i need

601
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,039
more and more and more have you ever

602
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,520
heard any advertising on tv to consume

603
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
less

604
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,559
no no way

605
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,120
whether you need a six cylinder car or

606
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,679
not

607
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,679
you have to buy it and hurry up

608
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,880
when i was driving here on the local

609
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,480
radio station

610
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,159
an excited announcer said you hurry up

611
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,080
rush and save save save there is a

612
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
plenty houses sale

613
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,039
save by buying more

614
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,520
of course of course it would be too

615
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,760
naive to expect that kgb makes that

616
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
advertising agency

617
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,440
to do such a crazy commercial no of

618
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
course not

619
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,360
but what we did when i was working for

620
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
novelist ukraine

621
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,720
we would snow plow editorial offices

622
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
student organizations religious group

623
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,760
with literature

624
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,600
of class struggle may if if not directly

625
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,400
marxism

626
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,320
is propaganda then a propaganda of

627
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,640
of a legitimate aspirations of working

628
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
class

629
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,440
betterment of life equality equality

630
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,559
mind you president kennedy once said

631
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,480
people we will make america to believe

632
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
that people are born equal

633
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
are people born equal is there any

634
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,640
mentioning

635
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,919
in the bible or any other holy scripture

636
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,760
in any religion

637
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,440
any religion if you don't believe me go

638
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
to library and check it

639
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
there is not a single word about

640
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
equality

641
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,799
just the opposite by your deeds

642
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,919
god will judge you what you do is

643
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,720
important

644
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,320
the merit of your personality

645
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,799
you cannot legislate equality if you

646
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,840
want to be equal

647
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,240
you have to be equal you have to deserve

648
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
it

649
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,520
and yet we build our society on the

650
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
principle of equality we say people are

651
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,080
equal

652
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,159
we know it is false it's a lie

653
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,039
some people are tall and stupid others

654
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:35,840
are short bold and clever

655
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,540
if we make them

656
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,660
[Laughter]

657
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,840
if we make them equal by force

658
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,200
if we put the principle of equality in

659
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,360
the basis of our social political

660
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,880
structure

661
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,200
it's the same thing as building a house

662
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
on sand

663
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,360
sooner or later it will collapse and

664
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,080
that's exactly what happens

665
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,720
and we as soviet propaganda makers are

666
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,520
trying to

667
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
push you in the direction which you go

668
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,679
yourself equality yes

669
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,799
equality people are equal land of equal

670
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,440
opportunities

671
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,279
is it true or not think about it

672
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,200
equal opportunities should there be

673
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
equal opportunities

674
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,600
for me and for a lazy bastard who come

675
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,240
here

676
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
from some other country and immediately

677
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
registers as a welfare

678
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,600
uh recipient benefits i never received a

679
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,240
single

680
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,279
no sorry i did this once but i never

681
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,919
applied for welfare for the 13 years i

682
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,240
took

683
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,440
any job security guard

684
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,600
journalist taxi driver anything

685
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,440
well i was restless but some people

686
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,200
don't like it they

687
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
immediately so why should we be why

688
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,000
should we have equal opportunities

689
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,480
why the equal opportunity to excel

690
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
equal opportunity in equal circumstances

691
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,120
yes but we know people are different

692
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
to excel yes provided we reach the same

693
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,360
level of

694
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,399
excellency perfection which is

695
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,600
hypothetical

696
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,720
distant future yes maybe but we know

697
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,240
perfectly well that

698
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
even the best intentions people could

699
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,840
not

700
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,279
be equal why should we have equality in

701
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,200
in the say legal system myself

702
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,279
i'm considering myself a law abiding

703
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
citizen

704
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,600
and the person who comes here to rob and

705
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,240
shoot say

706
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,039
the united states administration on the

707
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,600
card

708
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,840
imported thousands of cuban criminals

709
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,559
they were non-criminals yet they were

710
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,000
accepted

711
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,559
do you think it's fair if myself and my

712
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,600
wife from philippines who work like

713
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,320
excuse me horace as a lab technician in

714
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,360
the hospital

715
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,840
should have the same rights as a

716
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,279
criminal film from cuba

717
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,480
why and yet we repeat as parents

718
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
equality equality equality

719
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
and the soviet propaganda system helps

720
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
us to believe that equality is something

721
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,399
which is desirable

722
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,480
democracy as it was established by

723
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,000
fathers of this country

724
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,120
of the system in the last century

725
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,559
is is not equality

726
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,799
is the system where different people

727
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,159
unequal people

728
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,240
have a chance to survive and help each

729
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,200
other

730
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,399
in constant competition in constant

731
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,720
perfection

732
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,039
not inequality which is superimposed

733
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,000
from from

734
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,039
a godfather or a nice person in

735
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,200
washington dc

736
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,320
and the absolute equality exists in

737
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
soviet union

738
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,240
quote unquote equality everybody is

739
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,200
equally

740
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
in dirt except some people are more

741
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,680
equal than the others in politburo

742
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,240
[Laughter]

743
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,159
so the moment you you bring a country

744
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,240
to the point of almost total

745
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,080
demoralization when nothing

746
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,880
works anymore when you are not sure that

747
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,080
it is right or

748
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,600
or wrong good and bad but there is no

749
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
division between evil and good

750
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,080
when even the leaders of church

751
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,880
sometimes say

752
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,840
well violence for the sake of justice

753
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
especially social justice is justified

754
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,679
in the countries like

755
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,799
nicaragua el salvador well maybe

756
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,320
rhodesia

757
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,559
and we listen to them and say yeah

758
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,440
probably

759
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,559
it's true is it true no it is not true

760
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,440
violence is not justified especially for

761
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,240
the sake of

762
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,880
quote-unquote social justice introduced

763
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,240
by marxist levines

764
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,880
that is my former colleagues from noaa's

765
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,000
depressed agency

766
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,080
okay so where is that point the next

767
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,679
step is destabilization

768
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,799
again this word says for itself what it

769
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,399
is to destabilize

770
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,039
all the relations all the accepted

771
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,559
institutions

772
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,640
and organizations in the country of your

773
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
enemy how you do it

774
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
you don't have to send up a battalion of

775
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,000
kgb

776
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,720
agents to blow up bridges no you let

777
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,519
them do it themselves

778
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,559
the area of application is again it's

779
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,760
it's narrower now not like the previous

780
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,559
case

781
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,679
the overt legitimate actions of the

782
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,200
of the kgb in this case would be

783
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
hardly noticeable there is no crime if a

784
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,159
professor who recently went to ussr

785
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,399
introduces a course of marxism leninism

786
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,440
in a californian college for example

787
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,880
nobody is going to to come to his

788
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
doorstep and say okay

789
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,519
mister come you're under arrest no it's

790
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,320
not a crime

791
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,640
it's not even considered a moral crime

792
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
against your country

793
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,640
so the area of application here is

794
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,240
narrowing down

795
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,919
to economy again labor relations

796
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,159
right to law and order

797
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
plus military

798
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
and the economy law and order

799
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,440
yes and again the uh media but

800
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,399
uh wider scope little bit different i'll

801
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:34,880
explain

802
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,559
when okay basically three areas

803
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,720
economy the

804
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,120
radicalization of bargaining process

805
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,440
if on that stage we still could achieve

806
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
theoretically some positive compromise

807
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,120
between the

808
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,399
negotiating sides with with uh

809
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,000
say our arbitrary

810
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
introduction of arbitrary judges third

811
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,600
side

812
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,880
objectively judging the demands of both

813
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,320
sides here it's radicalization

814
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,639
on this on the stage of destabilization

815
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,520
we cannot

816
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,399
come to compromise even within a family

817
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,399
the husband and wife couldn't figure out

818
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,199
which is better husband wants his kids

819
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
to eat at the table and wife

820
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,760
wants him a child to roam around the

821
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,639
room and

822
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,879
and drop food all over the floor they

823
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,719
cannot come to compromise

824
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,359
unless they start a fight it's

825
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,119
impossible to reach a compromise

826
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,719
constructive compromise between

827
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,839
neighbors

828
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,839
some people say i don't like you to

829
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,839
watering you alone at that time because

830
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,000
exactly at that time i'm walking my dog

831
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and he's getting nervous

832
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,599
he cannot pass his bowels you know so

833
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,960
they cannot compromise they go to

834
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,520
a a civil court or something like that

835
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,920
radicalization of human relations

836
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,960
no more compromise fight fight fight

837
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
the normal traditionally accepted

838
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,680
relations are destabilized

839
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,440
the relations between teachers and

840
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,119
students

841
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,960
in schools and colleges fight

842
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,280
the the relations between in economical

843
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,800
sphere between

844
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,320
laborers and and employers are further

845
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,359
radicalized no more

846
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,880
acceptance of the legitimacy of demands

847
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,400
of workers

848
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
unlike japanese with the theory if you

849
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,560
ever heard about it

850
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,079
where the workers are involved in

851
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,839
decision-making process therefore they

852
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:38,560
don't have

853
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,400
uh moral incentive to to fight their uh

854
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,160
their bosses in the united states is

855
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
just the opposite the harder is the

856
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
the fight the better the more heroic

857
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,839
they look

858
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,440
when the greyhound network was on strike

859
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
recently

860
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
the correspondence of local tv networks

861
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,680
uh all over the united states were

862
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
approaching these strikers and they say

863
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,760
oh yes we are doing something nice they

864
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
look like heroes and they were proud

865
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,839
there was some family the husband

866
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,640
was a bus driver now they decided in

867
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,079
in in the protest against the uh bosses

868
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,400
to

869
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,359
camp somewhere in the forest and they

870
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,920
were presented to the to the audience as

871
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
as a heroic nice people

872
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,000
you see the violent clashes between

873
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,839
passengers ticketers and and the

874
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,960
strikers

875
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,640
are presented as something normal

876
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,280
10 15 20 years ago we would we would be

877
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,599
we would be angry say why why why so

878
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,920
much hatred

879
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,680
today we are not we say well commonplace

880
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,800
radicalization militarization sometimes

881
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,839
as i explained on that stage i

882
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,079
took a step a little bit further

883
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,440
shooting people

884
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,560
okay law and order now

885
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,160
also is uh

886
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,960
pushed into the area where previously

887
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,839
people

888
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,800
settle their differences uh peacefully

889
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
and legitimately

890
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,880
now we are getting with this uh

891
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
court cases in this smallest

892
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,880
irrelevant cases we cannot solve our

893
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,800
problems anymore

894
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,359
the society at large becomes more and

895
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
more antagonistic

896
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,599
between individuals between groups of

897
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,880
individuals and the society at large

898
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,079
the media puts himself in the opposition

899
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,200
to the society

900
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,400
in general at large

901
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,320
separate alienated okay

902
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,040
on that stage you remember i was talking

903
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,359
uh

904
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,839
a couple of hours ago about the sleepers

905
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,720
that's when the students from say united

906
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,359
states

907
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
if they're trained in lumumba university

908
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
or developing nations that's the

909
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
students i was dealing with

910
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,560
are being sent back from the soviet

911
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,839
union here

912
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,000
or if they were already in the united

913
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,119
states in the country

914
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,240
which is the object of subversion they

915
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,760
spring to action

916
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,040
the sleepers go up

917
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,880
they slept for 15 to 20 years

918
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,079
now they become leaders of groups

919
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,359
preachers uh

920
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,839
i don't know public public figures

921
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:34,880
prominently

922
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,280
they act in they actively include

923
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,599
themselves in a political process

924
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,880
all of a sudden we see a homosexual

925
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,000
15 years ago he did his dirty job

926
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,320
and nobody cared now he makes it a

927
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,200
political

928
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,240
issue a political issue

929
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,880
he demands recognition respect human

930
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,599
rights

931
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,720
and hiral is a large group of people and

932
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,240
their violent clashes

933
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,640
between him and police his group and

934
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,920
ordinary people

935
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,640
no matter what it's black against white

936
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
yellows again green doesn't matter

937
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,599
where's the vision line goes as long as

938
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,160
this group come into antagonistic clash

939
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,720
sometimes militantly sometimes with

940
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,240
firearms

941
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,200
that is the stabilization process the

942
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,560
sleepers

943
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,760
many of whom are simply kgb agents

944
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,040
become leaders of the process of this

945
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,480
civilization

946
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
doesn't mean that comrade and drop off

947
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,960
sends comrades off the united states

948
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,040
the person who takes care is already

949
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
here

950
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
he's a respected citizen of united

951
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
states sometimes he he gets

952
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
money from various foundations for his

953
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
legitimate

954
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,119
struggle for i don't know human rights

955
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,800
women rights kid lib prison lib whatever

956
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,320
there are sympathetic americans who

957
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,040
donate their money to him

958
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
this to be like this stabilization

959
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
process usually leads directly

960
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,160
to the process of crisis in case of

961
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,720
developing nations

962
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,839
there's the area where i i was active

963
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,079
the process starts

964
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,880
when when the

965
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,240
legitimate bodies

966
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,760
of power the social structure collapse

967
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,800
it cannot function anymore

968
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,280
so instead we have artificial body

969
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,839
injected into society such as

970
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,240
non-elected committees

971
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,839
you remember i was talking about them

972
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,160
here social workers

973
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,400
who are not elected by people media who

974
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,240
sell who are self-appointed rulers of

975
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,720
your

976
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,640
opinion uh some strange groups

977
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,440
uh which claim that they know how to

978
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
lead society forward

979
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,359
they don't usually all they care is how

980
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,040
to collect the nations and

981
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,000
and from and sell their own concocted

982
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,880
ideology

983
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,400
mixture of religion and ideology here

984
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,560
we have all this artificial body

985
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,760
claiming power

986
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
if the power is denied to them they take

987
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,319
it by force

988
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,160
in case of iran for example all of a

989
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
sudden we have revolutionary communities

990
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
who were what what kind of revolution

991
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,920
there was no revolution yet

992
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
and yet they had the committees they

993
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,000
were taking power of

994
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,240
of judgement they had they had the power

995
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
of execution they had the power

996
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
of of legislation and that

997
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,480
they had the power of judicial

998
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,319
all of them combined in one person who

999
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,640
is half-baked intellectual sometimes

1000
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,040
graduated from harvard university or

1001
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,359
berkeley

1002
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,079
he comes back to his country and he

1003
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,920
thinks that he knows the answer to all

1004
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,560
the social economical problems

1005
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,400
okay crisis is when society cannot

1006
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,240
function any more productively it

1007
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,040
collapses

1008
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,920
obviously that's the word for crisis so

1009
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,040
therefore

1010
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,400
the population at large is looking for a

1011
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,160
savior

1012
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,319
the religious groups are expecting a

1013
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,160
messiah to come

1014
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,520
the workers say we have family to feed

1015
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,680
let's have a strong government maybe

1016
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,760
socialist government centralized when

1017
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,960
when somebody put put their employers on

1018
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,839
their place

1019
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,880
and let us work we are sick and tired of

1020
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,160
going to strike and

1021
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
missing overtime and all that stuff we

1022
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,319
need some strong man

1023
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,000
strong government a leader

1024
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,280
a savior is needed population is sick

1025
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,440
and tired already

1026
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,560
and here we are we have a savior either

1027
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,960
a foreign nation comes in

1028
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,400
or the local group of leftists

1029
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,160
marxist no matter what they call

1030
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,560
themselves sandinista

1031
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,599
a reverend or some sort

1032
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,200
bishop mozareva like in zimbabwe

1033
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,800
doesn't matter a savior comes and says i

1034
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,359
will

1035
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,599
lead you so we have two alternatives

1036
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,839
here

1037
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,960
civil war and invasion

1038
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,720
okay see how it goes

1039
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,880
civil war we know what it is lebanon is

1040
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,400
the best example

1041
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,040
the civil war which was artificially

1042
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,319
implanted

1043
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,079
in lebanon by injection of force of plo

1044
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,640
palestinian liberation organization

1045
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,280
invasion

1046
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,960
we have in many other countries like

1047
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,760
afghanistan

1048
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,520
name any east european country it was

1049
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,640
invaded by the soviet army

1050
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,480
but the result is the same the next

1051
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,440
stage is

1052
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,000
normalization normalization

1053
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,160
is a very ironic word of course

1054
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,000
it is bordered from 1968 situation in

1055
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,520
czechoslovakia when the soviet

1056
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,880
propaganda

1057
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,800
and after them new york times declared

1058
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,560
the country is normalized

1059
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,480
the tanks moved into prague so there is

1060
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,960
no more prague spring there is no more

1061
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,000
violence

1062
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,119
normal normalization

1063
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,160
at that stage the

1064
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,480
self-appointed rulers of the society

1065
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,720
don't need any revolution anymore they

1066
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,640
don't need any radicalism anymore

1067
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,000
so this is the reverse from

1068
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,480
destabilization

1069
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,119
basically it is stabilizing the country

1070
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,960
by force

1071
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,839
so all these sleepers and activists and

1072
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,040
social workers

1073
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,480
and liberals and homosexuals

1074
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,880
and professors and marxists and letting

1075
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,680
us

1076
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,480
are being eliminated physically

1077
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,839
sometimes

1078
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,160
they've done their job already okay they

1079
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,839
are not needed anymore

1080
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,280
the new rulers need stability to exploit

1081
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
the nation to exploit the country to

1082
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,119
take advantages

1083
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,920
of the victory okay so no more

1084
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,319
revolutionaries please and that's

1085
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,839
exactly what happens in number of

1086
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,560
countries

1087
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,400
you remember bangladesh this is the

1088
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,319
crisis in which i was instrumental

1089
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,440
first they had mujibur rahman

1090
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,240
in 1971 he was the leader of people's

1091
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,200
party league with mustache like stalin

1092
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,079
he was in

1093
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,680
in russia many times in five years he

1094
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
was shot by his former colleagues

1095
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,680
marxists he fulfilled his function in

1096
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,240
afghanistan it happened three times

1097
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,680
because there was taraki then there was

1098
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,359
amin nowadays

1099
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,400
they killed each other successively one

1100
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,359
after another

1101
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,520
the moment he fulfills his duty the

1102
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,680
first one demoralized country the second

1103
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,720
distabilized

1104
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,960
the third one brought it to crisis

1105
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,440
goodbye comrades

1106
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
carmilla comes from moscow and put him

1107
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,079
into the seat of power

1108
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,880
same thing happened in granada recently

1109
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,160
maurice bishop

1110
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
marxist was killed by austin what's his

1111
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,079
name general something

1112
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,760
it was also a marxism right

1113
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
so no more revolutions please

1114
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
normalization now

1115
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
from now on no more strikes no more

1116
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,359
homosexual

1117
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,920
sexuals no more women leave no more

1118
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,880
kidney

1119
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,000
no more lib period

1120
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:39,760
good solid democratic proletarian

1121
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,599
freedom

1122
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,640
now to reverse this process

1123
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,560
takes enormous effort when today

1124
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,319
united states had to invade granada

1125
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,040
to reverse the process of subversion

1126
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,920
some people say

1127
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,560
boy this is not good it's not kosher to

1128
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,079
invade the beautiful country

1129
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,599
island of granada well why didn't you

1130
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,119
stop the process here

1131
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,200
when granada was just approached by

1132
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,640
leftists

1133
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,400
why not to prevent maurice bishop to

1134
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
come in power in the first place

1135
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,960
did grenadas want him very questionable

1136
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,560
they didn't know who was mortis bishop

1137
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,440
in the first place

1138
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,119
he came to power by kudeta himself

1139
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,000
okay now we let the situation develop

1140
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,599
further and further and further until

1141
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,760
the crisis

1142
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,880
and normalization very soon

1143
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,119
and then united states decided to invade

1144
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,480
country discovering that

1145
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,720
the country was absolutely a military

1146
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,520
base for the soviet union

1147
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,119
of course it's a drastic measure of

1148
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,880
course it's it's repeated that

1149
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
marine corps had to to lose what 17

1150
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,359
lives very bad

1151
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,119
why not to stop the process before it

1152
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,720
comes to crisis

1153
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,040
or no intellectuals will not let you

1154
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,000
it's interference into domestic affairs

1155
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,720
they're very careful not to not not to

1156
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,040
let

1157
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,280
american administration to interfere in

1158
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
domestic affairs of latin american

1159
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,760
characters

1160
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,520
they don't mind soviet union interfere

1161
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,160
in this affair

1162
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,280
so to reverse this process from here

1163
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,680
it takes only and always military force

1164
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,240
no other force on earth can reverse this

1165
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,880
process at this point

1166
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,839
at this point it does not take military

1167
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,480
invasion

1168
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,599
of united states army it takes strong

1169
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,640
action like in chile

1170
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,079
as cia covert involvement

1171
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,800
to prevent the savior from outside to

1172
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,720
come into power

1173
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,559
and to stabilize country before it

1174
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
erupts into civil war

1175
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,280
country before it erupts into civil war

1176
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,960
okay support the right-wing conservative

1177
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,119
forces buy money by crooks so love

1178
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,480
doesn't matter

1179
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,240
stabilize and don't let the crisis

1180
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,359
develop into into civil war or invasion

1181
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,520
oh no your liberals will say it's

1182
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,000
against the law

1183
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,240
the congress will not appropriate money

1184
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,839
for covert actions

1185
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,960
of cia why not

1186
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
should we wait till the normalization

1187
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
come and soviet tanks landed in in los

1188
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,599
angeles airport

1189
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,839
now at that point at the point of

1190
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:22,960
destabilization

1191
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,440
also the process could be reversed again

1192
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,640
easily than this

1193
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,599
no cia involvement at this point you

1194
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,240
know what it takes here

1195
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,520
restriction of some liberties for small

1196
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,240
groups which are self-declared enemies

1197
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,680
of the society

1198
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,480
as simple as that oh no the median

1199
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,000
liberals will tell you this is against

1200
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,720
the american constitution

1201
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,359
how can we

1202
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,280
by force deny the civil rights to

1203
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,880
criminals for example

1204
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,280
it's not good okay so we allow them to

1205
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,280
okay if you allow the criminals to have

1206
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,599
civil rights go on and bring the country

1207
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,559
to the crisis

1208
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,680
this is a bloodless way to do curb the

1209
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,920
rights i mean not to put them in prison

1210
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,599
no no i'm not talking about putting all

1211
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,040
the gates from san francisco in the

1212
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,720
concentration camp

1213
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,760
do not allow them to take

1214
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,920
political force do not elect them to the

1215
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,480
seats of power whether it is

1216
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,760
municipality

1217
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,040
state level or federal level it has to

1218
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,440
be

1219
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,559
bitten in the heads of american voters

1220
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,400
that the person like that in the cities

1221
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,839
of power is an

1222
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,960
enemy do not be afraid of this word it

1223
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,000
is an enemy if he is not an enemy here

1224
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,160
he will be here

1225
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,839
later on he will be shot of course

1226
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,359
but at this point he is an enemy

1227
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,240
okay you are doing great service by

1228
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,800
denying him a right

1229
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,880
to capitalize on his own crazy ideas and

1230
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
become

1231
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,520
a powerful man a man who uses

1232
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,440
the seat of power restriction of certain

1233
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
freedoms and permissiveness at that

1234
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
point

1235
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,880
would prevent sliding into crisis and

1236
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,559
probably will return the process of

1237
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,000
destabilization

1238
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,800
to curb unlimited power monopolistic

1239
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,160
power of trade unions

1240
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,880
here at that point would save economy

1241
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,880
from collapsing

1242
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,400
to introduce a law to stop

1243
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,599
private companies of raping public

1244
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,480
opinions

1245
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,280
mind income in the in the direction of

1246
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,359
consumerism

1247
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,880
no company must have a right

1248
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,680
to force you into buying more unless you

1249
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,559
want it

1250
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,200
there must be a law you want to

1251
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,640
advertise your car

1252
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,079
okay but not a single mentioning of

1253
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,760
buying it now and saving

1254
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,839
it money be against the law to force

1255
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,200
people to consume more

1256
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,040
self-restraint previously before this

1257
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,400
process started

1258
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
the self-restraint was the business of

1259
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,960
church religion because our preachers

1260
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,760
the fathers of church would tell us

1261
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,800
material values are good but it's not

1262
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,839
the prime

1263
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,319
function of human being because you have

1264
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,280
to live with

1265
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,920
something obviously the design for our

1266
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,400
life

1267
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,319
is not to consume more deodorant

1268
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,119
there must be something greater if such

1269
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,559
a complicated

1270
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,680
instrument this human body was created

1271
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,359
obviously there must be some higher

1272
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,000
purpose for that

1273
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,760
and it's very easy to avoid

1274
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,240
destabilization by denying

1275
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,000
the greedy companies one little freedom

1276
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,960
one little liberty forcing you into

1277
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,000
turning yourself

1278
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,040
into processors of unwanted

1279
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,640
products and goods they turn you into

1280
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,720
machines

1281
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,480
like a the worm who there is inlet and

1282
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,839
outlet so

1283
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,160
and how long an average appliance lasts

1284
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,599
these days

1285
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,200
less than a year why

1286
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,559
where's workmanship we want you to buy

1287
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,760
more okay this stabilization process

1288
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,119
could be easily overcome if as i say

1289
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,559
the society by its own will or after

1290
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,119
persuasion by the leaders

1291
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,359
will come to the idea of self-restraint

1292
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,760
it's so hard we want to consume more but

1293
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,680
you have to

1294
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,400
unless you will come to this stage when

1295
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,599
as we say in russia

1296
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,680
if sahara desert ever becomes a

1297
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,720
communist state

1298
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,079
there will be shortage of sand

1299
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,250
so you have to curb your

1300
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,160
[Laughter]

1301
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,760
you have to you have to curb your

1302
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,800
expectations at this point

1303
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,040
before it's too late but no we don't

1304
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,800
want to do it

1305
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,680
demoralization process again it's the

1306
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,079
easiest thing to reverse

1307
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,359
first of all by restricting import of

1308
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,640
propaganda

1309
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,960
the easiest thing to do

1310
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,280
unlimited unrestrained import of

1311
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,880
soviet literature soviet journalists

1312
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,680
uh giving soviet propaganda and

1313
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,079
ideological agitators equal time on

1314
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,640
american tv network

1315
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,160
it has to be stopped and it's easy

1316
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,559
they won't they won't be offended minded

1317
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,400
as a matter of fact they will respect

1318
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,960
america more

1319
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,960
but then my former colleague vladimir

1320
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,960
posner appears on nightline

1321
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,119
and ted koppel asking well vladimir what

1322
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,559
do you think about this

1323
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,280
what can he think he is an instrument of

1324
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,079
propaganda

1325
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,680
he thinks what what what comrade

1326
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,319
andropov tells him to think

1327
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,040
he is just a nice articulate mouthpiece

1328
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,160
of the soviet uh

1329
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,880
uh subversion system and ted cottle

1330
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,319
makes you believe

1331
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,359
that my friend vladimir posner thinks

1332
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,839
the process of demoralization may not

1333
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,960
have started at

1334
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,559
all if at that point

1335
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,599
the country which is a recipient of

1336
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,799
subversion actively

1337
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,599
not violently but actively prevents

1338
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,960
importation of foreign ideology

1339
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,280
i don't want america to follow the

1340
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,119
pattern of ancient japan

1341
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,119
you don't have to shoot every foreigner

1342
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,559
when it approaches

1343
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,599
the sacred borders of the united states

1344
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,319
but when he offers you a junk in the

1345
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,200
disguise of very shiny something

1346
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,110
we have to tell him no we have our own

1347
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:14,839
[Laughter]

1348
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,440
junk

1349
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,000
if at that point the society is strong

1350
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,920
brave and conscientious enough

1351
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,839
to stop importation of ideas which are

1352
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,839
foreign

1353
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,559
then the whole chain of events could be

1354
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,480
prevented

1355
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,040
recently i've been to philippines and i

1356
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,200
was shocked

1357
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,319
how in big cities like manila children

1358
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,040
listen to

1359
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,280
deafening music a melodious

1360
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,799
nation with long traditions of good

1361
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,480
nice ethnic music introduced by spanish

1362
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,760
long time ago maybe two centuries three

1363
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,680
centuries ago i don't remember

1364
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,520
all of a sudden listen to musical

1365
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,599
garbage

1366
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,240
blasting their radios at full blast at

1367
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,040
the

1368
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,400
full volume why in

1369
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,839
india i spent many years watching the

1370
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:16,799
reactions of

1371
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,880
indians walking out of movie theaters

1372
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,319
after seeing hollywood production

1373
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,119
they they couldn't figure out why

1374
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,280
americans are so wasteful they smash

1375
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,240
their cars

1376
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,440
their shiny cars every five minutes how

1377
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,040
come they shoot each other for half a

1378
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,920
million dollars

1379
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,000
is it true that they are so sex sex

1380
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,280
i mean obsessed with sex can you imagine

1381
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,960
showing a movie

1382
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,440
where each five minutes there's a

1383
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,400
copulation

1384
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,720
on the screen to a country like india

1385
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,000
with long traditions

1386
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,599
tradition of of respect to this private

1387
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,480
matters

1388
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,680
or to pakistan

1389
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,200
and united states expect these people to

1390
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,040
respect you

1391
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,680
no way oh yes they will see the movie

1392
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,280
they'll pay five rupees to see that

1393
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,839
garbage

1394
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,599
but they walk out and will tell their

1395
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,760
kids don't

1396
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,520
respect americans don't be like

1397
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,200
americans

1398
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,000
see so the process of demoralization

1399
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,280
could be stopped right here

1400
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,480
both as an expert and as an import

1401
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,160
and that takes one step one very

1402
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,760
important thing to do

1403
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,839
you don't have to expel all the kgb

1404
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,640
agents from washington dc

1405
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,799
the most difficult and at the same time

1406
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,799
the simplest answer

1407
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,839
to the subversion is to start it here

1408
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,599
and even before

1409
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,799
by bringing back the society to

1410
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,839
religion something that you cannot touch

1411
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,400
and eat and put on yourself but

1412
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,640
something that rules society and makes

1413
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,280
it move

1414
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,240
and preserve it a soviet scientist

1415
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,480
who has nothing to do with religion he

1416
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,119
is a computer scientist

1417
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,839
did a very intensive research on the

1418
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,559
history of socialist countries

1419
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,720
he called socialist or communist any

1420
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,280
country with a centralized economy

1421
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,119
and the pyramidal style of power

1422
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,880
structure

1423
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,520
and he discovered actually he didn't

1424
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,720
discover it he just

1425
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,280
brought to attention of his readers that

1426
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,640
civilizations like mohan jodaro

1427
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,400
in the river hindus area

1428
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,559
like egypt like maya incas

1429
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,119
like below but the bologna culture

1430
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,119
collapsed and disappeared from the

1431
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,079
surface of earth the moment they lost

1432
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,920
religion

1433
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,400
as simple as that they disintegrated

1434
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,799
nobody remembers about them anymore

1435
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:03,520
well distantly so

1436
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,280
the ideas are moving society and keeping

1437
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,240
mankind

1438
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,040
as a society of human beings intelligent

1439
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,400
moral agents of god

1440
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,480
the facts the truth the exact knowledge

1441
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,160
may not

1442
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,000
all the sophisticated technology and

1443
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,720
computers will not prevent society from

1444
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,880
disintegrating and eventually dying out

1445
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,480
have you ever met a person who would

1446
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,920
sacrifice his

1447
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,200
life freedom for the truth like that

1448
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,880
this is truth i never met the person who

1449
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,799
said this is truth and i'm ready to

1450
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,280
shoot me

1451
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,839
to defend the truth right

1452
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,880
but millions sacrifice their life

1453
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,040
freedom comfort everything

1454
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,200
for things like god

1455
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,400
like jesus christ it's an honor

1456
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,839
some markers in in the soviet

1457
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,880
concentration camp died

1458
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,319
and they died in peace unlike those who

1459
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,160
shouted longleaf stalin

1460
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,559
knowing perfectly well that he may not

1461
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,200
live long

1462
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,160
something which is

1463
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,640
something which is not material

1464
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,280
moves society and helps it to survive

1465
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,359
and the other way around the moment we

1466
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,640
turn into two by two is four

1467
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,640
and make it a guiding principle of our

1468
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,440
life our existence

1469
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,960
we die even though this is true

1470
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,160
and this we cannot prove we only can

1471
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:54,640
feel

1472
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,599
and have faith in it so the answer to

1473
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,920
ideological subversion

1474
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,559
strangely enough is very simple you

1475
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,319
don't have to shoot people you don't

1476
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,520
have

1477
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,200
to aim missiles and pershings and cruise

1478
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,079
missiles

1479
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,599
at androple's headquarters you simply

1480
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,760
have to have faith

1481
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,000
and prevent subversion in other words

1482
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,880
not to be a victim of subversion don't

1483
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,319
try to be a person

1484
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,359
who in judo is trying to smash your

1485
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,400
enemy

1486
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,839
and being caught by your hand

1487
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:35,280
don't strike like that strike with power

1488
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,160
you have spirit

1489
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,440
and moral superiority if you don't have

1490
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,240
the power it's high time to develop it

1491
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,520
and that's the only answer

1492
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,839
that's it

1493
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:15,039
[Applause]

1494
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,119
you
