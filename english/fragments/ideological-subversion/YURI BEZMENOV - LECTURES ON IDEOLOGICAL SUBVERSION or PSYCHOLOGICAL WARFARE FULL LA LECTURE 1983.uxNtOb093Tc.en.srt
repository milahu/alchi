activity which is usually given to

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Soviet young Communists as a non-paid

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,560
job to prove loyalty to the party I was

an ideological indoctrination class it

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,300
was mainly Russian language instruction

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,980
after which these students usually

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,140
joined two-year or three-year extensive

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,120
course in Marxist leninist ideal

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,599
ideological indoctrination plus their

55
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,739
if they if after five or six years

56
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,420
studying they

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,720
but they're proven to be well flexible

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,540
loyal uh cynical enough to follow the

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,700
Soviet foreign policy they are being

60
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,160
transferred to a KGB school for for the

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,260
for a period of two years after which

62
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,640
they are being dispatched back to their

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,860
native countries and become so-called

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,440
sleepers

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,659
the word from originated from sleeping

66
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,879
for several years they sleep in their

67
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,379
own countries doing nothing sometimes

68
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,760
they're pursuing their own careers

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
become lawyers doctors teachers taxi

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,080
drivers Barbers and they spring into

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,060
action after many years of

72
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,800
destabilization of their own countries

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
as Soviet agents therefore all of a

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,440
sudden you discover uh well-established

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
lawyers in a country like Nicaragua who

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
are for some strange reason are

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,239
bitterly against quote-unquote American

78
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,819
imperialism and idealistically for

79
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,900
Soviet Marxist leninist imperialism

80
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,760
I joined Novac press agency uh before I

81
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,500
graduated from the Oriental Studies

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,840
Institute where I studied Hindi and Urdu

83
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,680
two languages of Indian subcontinent

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,120
Urdu is the language of Pakistan and

85
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,739
Hindi is the language of India

86
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:12,780
the journalistic part of my training was

87
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,879
ordinary journalism mass media a

88
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,399
communication theories and studies

89
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,680
together with that we had a very

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,500
extensive training in military civil

91
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,040
defense intelligence and ideological

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,860
subversion so even before I graduated I

93
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,600
started working with novice depressed

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,080
agency first as a translator interpreter

95
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,060
and guide with foreign delegations who

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,240
were invited to USSR and who were shown

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,400
all the beauties of socialism and

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,960
dispatched back to their countries to

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,780
explain to uh to their

100
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,860
people how beautiful is socialism

101
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,040
my role was directly linked with KGB

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,139
activities of brainwashing and

103
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,180
psychological assessment of these guests

104
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,120
if they showed any sign of flexibility

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,300
which means they showed that they were

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,419
recruitable I passed them over to

107
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,639
professional KGB recruiters and from

108
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
there on they were actively being

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,080
involved in ideological subversion and

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,780
propaganda both in USSR and in their own

111
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,199
countries

112
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,660
well decision of course was very painful

113
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,820
and and difficult

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,100
but on the other hand I didn't have any

115
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,320
Illusions or Illusions about the Soviet

116
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,300
system and and Communists or socialist

117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,120
system as the most rotten and unworking

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,880
system in the world some people call it

119
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
State capitalism socialism centralized

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,340
planning whatever it doesn't really

121
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,380
matter what kind of name you attach to

122
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,780
the system basically if you're a

123
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,000
religious person it's a devilish set and

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,360
satanistic system which appeals only to

125
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,820
the most primitive negative side of

126
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,759
human nature

127
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,740
it's the basis of that system is denial

128
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,440
of private property human dignity and

129
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,600
and personal responsibility and of

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,460
course any religion religious

131
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,100
affiliation of a human being to God as a

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,919
Supreme Being

133
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,960
my dissatisfaction disillusionment if

134
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,520
you can call it because I never was

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,919
illusioned

136
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,020
with this with the communism started as

137
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,360
early as

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,139
age from age six I guess uh

139
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,440
the first shock was after the second

140
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,759
World War

141
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,819
when most of the children of my age

142
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,460
understood that United States is the

143
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,479
friend

144
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,180
uh with whom together Soviet people

145
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,900
defeated Nazis and German fascism all of

146
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,340
a sudden turned into an enemy

147
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,600
and all of a sudden the propaganda

148
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,180
turned

149
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,860
180 degrees around and we were

150
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,780
brainwashed in the spirit of hatred to

151
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,180
everything which is American but how

152
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,400
could you explain to a child of six

153
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,860
years old who holds his survival to

154
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,220
American spam condensed milk egg powder

155
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,960
and things which you probably people

156
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,180
never remember because nobody eats them

157
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,220
these days spam meat you know what I'm

158
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,100
talking about

159
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,780
how can you explain to them that these

160
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,660
delicious things came from an enemy who

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,360
wants to subvert and destroy us it's

162
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,099
impossible because the child remembers

163
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,319
when he was hungry he was eating spam

164
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,919
and and drinking condensed American

165
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,740
milk with the American Eagle on the on

166
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,800
the level so all the efforts of the

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,840
Soviet propaganda to convince me that

168
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,860
America is bad was futile naturally

169
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,840
that was the first joke the second was

170
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,699
this 20th Congress of the Soviet

171
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,740
Communist party when Khrushchev revealed

172
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,819
the atrocities of Stalin terrorism and

173
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,360
murder systematic murder of millions of

174
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,460
innocent people that was another

175
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,580
greatest shock and the third shock of

176
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,500
course when I was already grown up a

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,020
student invasioned into Czechoslovakia

178
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,720
in 1968 that was the last point

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,720
and when I was in India acting as a

180
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,479
Soviet official so the Diplomat I

181
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,759
understood that sooner or later I have

182
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,220
to defect and to explain what exactly I

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,259
was doing in India I fell in love with

184
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,960
that country because at that time this

185
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,520
country didn't do any harm to any

186
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
neighbors least of all to the Soviet

187
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,419
Union and yet we did so much harm to

188
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,599
that country that I decided to defect

189
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,640
and explain at first to Indians then to

190
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,039
American

191
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,260
politicians intelligence communities and

192
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,120
media unfortunately I didn't have much

193
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,640
success because my stories were treated

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,760
by the great skepticism I was called

195
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,459
paranoid macarthy's fascist Cold War

196
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,620
maniac and other names which I don't

197
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,160
want to mention here and it took me

198
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,680
quite a number of years to understand

199
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,740
that I'm talking to people who are

200
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,740
trying to prevent average American from

201
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,660
knowing the truth about communism

202
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,000
the basic methods are not that much

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,860
different from activities of any Public

204
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,140
Relation officer from any big company

205
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,540
say Coca-Cola I bet they have their own

206
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,580
Department of Person of public relations

207
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,860
and press relations but the ultimate

208
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,420
goal the ultimate purpose is different

209
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,000
if Coca-Cola wants to make profit and to

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,220
sell more Coca-Cola to nations of the

211
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,560
world the Soviet Union the ultimate

212
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,779
purpose of the Soviet system is not to

213
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,540
sell anything list of all ideology is to

214
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,959
destroy the civilization on which the

215
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,080
affluence and freedom based and replace

216
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,300
it with the system of total control over

217
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,600
life of human beings the system of total

218
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,920
exploitation that's the ultimate purpose

219
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,080
my specific measures which which I was

220
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,300
forced to do unwillingly of course but I

221
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,040
had to do them just to promote myself

222
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,620
further and further is a bribery

223
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,839
corruption

224
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
befriending politicians members of

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,640
parliament influential Scholars

226
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,540
members of civil service businessmen

227
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,339
in other words anyone who has any

228
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,500
um anything to do with shaping of public

229
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,600
opinion in the interests of the Soviet

230
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,420
foreign policy

231
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,700
that would include a long process which

232
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,279
sometimes is unnoticeable to an average

233
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,680
person it's a long-term process which is

234
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,740
called so ideological subversion it's

235
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,140
unnoticeable as movement of a small hand

236
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,760
of a clock you know it's going around

237
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,180
but even if you watch it intensely you

238
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,880
don't see the movement the eventual

239
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,940
result is befriending these people and

240
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,860
trying to get them involved in the

241
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,260
activity in the interests of the Soviet

242
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,500
foreign policy the immediate impulse

243
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,019
when I learned that the Soviet Embassy

244
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,839
Department of research and Conquer

245
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,899
propaganda of which I was a deputy chief

246
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,060
is engaged neither in research nor in

247
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,339
Contra propaganda it is Department which

248
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,920
is compiling information of private

249
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
nature on individuals divided in two

250
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,380
groups good boys and bad boys the

251
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,860
sympathetic people were promoted in

252
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,160
media and public life the people who

253
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,380
were opposed to the Soviet foreign

254
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,980
policy were black washed blackmailed and

255
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,500
and destroyed first morally and

256
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,480
sometimes physically to

257
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,300
uh

258
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,500
understanding of what I was doing came

259
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,480
to me when I when I looked through a

260
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,860
press release of United States

261
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,839
information service describing an

262
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,300
incident in a South Vietnamese City of

263
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,760
Houston captured by Communists from

264
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,959
Hanoi for for 48 hours then it was

265
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,940
recultured by United States and South

266
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,240
Vietnamese armies and to the horror they

267
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
discovered that within two nights the

268
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,540
Communists could manage to round up more

269
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,240
than 15 000 people and execute them

270
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,320
most of these people were either

271
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,420
sympathetic to United States or to the

272
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,779
Western culture or directly involved in

273
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,200
activities

274
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,700
supporting the United States present in

275
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,160
South Vietnam agents of CIA naturally

276
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,380
even Barbers because they know too much

277
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,019
they were executed and the United States

278
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,060
intelligence couldn't figure out how

279
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,040
could they possibly do it in such short

280
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,180
period of time later on they discovered

281
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,180
they found out from several defectors

282
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,220
that long before Communists occupied

283
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,380
that City

284
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,440
there was an extensive

285
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,720
omnipresent network of informers who

286
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
knew exactly their dresses the names the

287
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
whereabouts of each individual who was

288
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,620
later executed

289
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,660
when I turned to my own files I

290
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,160
discovered that basically that

291
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,980
information exists in my department

292
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,959
so it doesn't take much intelligence to

293
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,000
understand what I was doing in India I

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,279
was compiling information comes

295
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,620
Revolution these people would be

296
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,019
executed

297
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,060
indirectly I was involved in in a

298
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,000
criminal activity in mass murder I

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,860
decided to defect and explain it to

300
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,560
Americans and the response I already

301
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,620
described I was called a paranoid

302
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,420
but I decided to defect and try

303
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,019
nevertheless

304
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
here's another long story it's virtually

305
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,279
impossible to defect in India simply

306
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,680
because Indian government under pressure

307
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,480
from the Soviet government if you can

308
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
call them government I don't call them

309
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,740
government I call them Junta they

310
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,120
adopted Allah as early as as in 61 or 62

311
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,519
after after Stalin's daughter defection

312
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,399
especially that law states that no

313
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,940
Embassy no no foreign

314
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,079
ligation on the territory of Indian

315
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,420
Republic has a right to extend

316
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,139
political Asylum to any Defector from

317
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,839
any country which is very it's it's a

318
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,579
masterpiece of hypocrisy no other

319
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,680
Defector but the Soviet one needs a

320
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,380
political Asylum

321
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,120
if you are a Canadian or American if you

322
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,620
want to be nasty to your own government

323
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,600
the maximum you can do is just to pick

324
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,120
up a phone and make a dirty phone call

325
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,940
to your Ambassador buy yourself a ticket

326
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,660
and get lost

327
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,579
what happens to a Soviet Defector in

328
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,680
under that law if I knock a door of

329
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,100
United States Embassy by that law the

330
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,779
American diplomats have to turn him back

331
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,459
to the Indian police and Indian police

332
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,440
takes me back directly back to the

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,980
Soviet Embassy and that's the end of my

334
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,079
defection so knowing that perfectly well

335
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,180
and having contacts both with Indian

336
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,320
police and American Media Corps I I

337
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,199
understood that the only way for me was

338
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,180
to

339
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,699
disappear for a while and the best way I

340
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,800
discovered was to mix with group of

341
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,399
hippies mind you that that

342
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,880
was the time

343
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,120
I was 13 years younger so I looked

344
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,139
slightly different of course

345
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,660
I started so-called Contra culture in

346
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,019
India sometimes

347
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,800
good sincere young people who wanted to

348
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,380
study Oriental mysticism and culture and

349
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,459
religion

350
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,339
but most of them were simply easygoing

351
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,040
individuals who were delighted with

352
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,720
exotic exotic life and and the easiness

353
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,880
with which they can purchase hashish and

354
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,300
Other Drugs in India and sometimes they

355
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,579
traveled Indian subcontinent without any

356
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,399
identification papers so the best way to

357
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,699
to escape detection was to mix with the

358
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,699
group of hippies and travel in India

359
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:05,220
until they campaign in the media and in

360
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,959
the police the police search will

361
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,720
subside all the newspapers in India

362
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,180
carried my picture and announcement of

363
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,139
the police

364
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,420
that anyone coming forward with

365
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,279
information about my whereabouts would

366
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,399
receive 5000 or 2 000 rupees knowing

367
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,560
that perfectly well I just walked in

368
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,079
their Barefoot with beads and blue jeans

369
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,839
smoking hush and

370
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:29,040
enjoying life

371
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,260
until I found sympathetic journalists

372
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,540
who smuggled me from India to briefs

373
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,459
minded that was a military dictatorship

374
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,860
at that time then only I approached

375
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,940
American CIA and they helped me to

376
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,019
land in Canada as a legit ordinary

377
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,519
immigrant

378
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,860
it's now I'm a Canadian citizen as you

379
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,779
can see from my patriotic diet

380
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,779
Canada is kind of middle of the way of

381
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,660
the road country where there are so many

382
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,020
various ethnic groups that another

383
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,819
strange character who speaks both

384
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,339
Russian and English and to Oriental

385
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,380
languages I I didn't have any problems

386
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,780
fitting into academic circles and first

387
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,880
being just a student at University of

388
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,640
Toronto later a producer with a Canadian

389
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,660
Broadcasting Corporation

390
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,140
I think it was successful and until and

391
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,740
unless that they'll be follow up to that

392
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,600
movie

393
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,200
it will remain as as an open wound in in

394
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,700
the United States

395
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,940
as a scare tactic which in this

396
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,100
particular case I'm not sure whether KGB

397
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,080
paid for production of that movie or not

398
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,660
but it's totally irrelevant what is the

399
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,880
most important unless

400
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,620
after seeing the tragic sequences of the

401
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,020
nuclear attack an American population is

402
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,539
not explained what to do about it if you

403
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,500
still stop at that and let it be

404
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,020
obviously this is the scare tactic this

405
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,660
is the greatest harm done to United

406
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,900
States by by Americans by American

407
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,320
filmmaker I bet on drop of in all his

408
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,960
disinformation

409
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,179
system could not could not possibly do

410
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,580
that much harm to the United States when

411
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,200
when you see something obviously

412
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,780
sponsored by the Soviets you understand

413
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,240
well this is propaganda you may or may

414
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,919
not agree with this depending on your

415
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,980
background and and intelligence and

416
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,620
education but here it's a subtle

417
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,620
approach playing on the most sensitive

418
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,860
strings of your soul appealing to to the

419
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,400
most Basic Instincts of of human nature

420
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
survival

421
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,380
but there are no answers how to survive

422
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,539
well obviously disarmament is not the

423
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,240
answer simply because some people

424
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,100
naively expect a drop off to blush out

425
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,840
of Shame and reduce the number of

426
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,140
warheads and it doesn't happen this way

427
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,620
this we are facing

428
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,179
unresponsive irresponsible group of

429
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,340
people for whom

430
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,480
uh nuclear war is not a theory it's a

431
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,419
practice and the military strategy of

432
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,780
the Soviet Union is designed to to do

433
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,539
nuclear war and to survive and possibly

434
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,620
to win

435
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,460
I I was I started my military training

436
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,460
when I was six or seven years old when I

437
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,400
when I entered Secondary School

438
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,700
and I graduated in 63 after almost 15

439
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,880
years of continuous training as a junior

440
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,600
Lieutenant of reserve of the Soviet Army

441
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,179
and

442
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:52,919
psychologically every Soviet citizen is

443
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,080
well prepared for for war nuclear war

444
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,380
and technically he is equipped with

445
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,559
facilities and the knowledge how to use

446
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,559
it in case of war or or natural disaster

447
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,760
doesn't matter

448
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,200
survival tactics and survival

449
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,539
methods are taught

450
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,120
extensively in in various manners they

451
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,700
are exposed to documentary movies about

452
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,640
nuclear war they know the the technical

453
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,960
data of radiation or contamination of of

454
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,080
air and and land they know the

455
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,140
organizational patterns of civil defense

456
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,840
to such an extent that even if there is

457
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
no nuclear attack even if there's a

458
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,780
conventional Warfare each individual

459
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,720
at a certain time knows exactly where to

460
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,620
go what to do where is the shelter whom

461
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,660
to call by telephone

462
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,940
which is not the case unfortunately in

463
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,280
the United States I think if if a bomb

464
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,679
ordinary bomb maybe a sting bomb is

465
00:20:58,679 --> 00:20:59,940
dropped in the middle of Los Angeles

466
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,400
most of the people will not die of

467
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
atomic radiation they will die of panic

468
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,840
they will they will run and the

469
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,500
traffic jams and and and the Panic will

470
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,860
kill more people than many anything else

471
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,160
and where do they go is is there any

472
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,620
literature about how to protect an

473
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,080
individual with the medical first aid

474
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,840
treatment but it's not taught to to kids

475
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,640
in American colleges unfortunately

476
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,640
for example there is obvious tension in

477
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,419
the world it's a television newscasts

478
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,460
inform American Family about happenings

479
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,700
in in East and West Germany and only at

480
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,440
the last moment they decide to bring the

481
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,320
canned food down to the basement and to

482
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,780
share idiocy why not to have them in the

483
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,799
basement

484
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,280
at the peacetime number two there's

485
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,679
there's very realistic picture of what

486
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,260
happens when the first nuclear bomb

487
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,500
strikes a big City Kansas City I think

488
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,820
in people's a big panoramic picture

489
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,480
shows almost an ant hill when you know

490
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,780
people are disoriented totally that

491
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,400
would produce love in Russia because

492
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,740
unlike that Soviets know exactly what to

493
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,539
do they'll be much less Panic if at all

494
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,320
thank you

495
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,740
I I know about infiltration of kgbin to

496
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,539
peace movement probably as much as an

497
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,240
average American who reads newspapers

498
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,280
systematically

499
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,700
but I I'm obviously I'm aware that the

500
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,799
world peace council is is a front

501
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,580
organization of the KGB Ramesh Chandra I

502
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,059
know personally both in India and USSR I

503
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,460
worked with delegations of of

504
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,100
various peace Nicks who came to the

505
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,460
World Congress of Peace Council in

506
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,360
Moscow I think it was in 1961 or 62.

507
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,240
yeah it was before Cuban crisis

508
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,480
and at that time they struck me as as

509
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,140
people who are pathologically unable to

510
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,720
see the truth

511
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,539
not to talk about the military aspects

512
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,240
when I when as a translator and a guy

513
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,580
that used to take them to places in

514
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,159
Moscow which are not supposed to be for

515
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,780
foreigners eyes

516
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,960
and they didn't want to see it they had

517
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,120
their preconceived ideas they they were

518
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,760
suffering from self-importance they

519
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,700
thought it's it's a great honor to sit

520
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,860
in the Kremlin in the Palace of of

521
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,120
congresses next to uh next to dibio from

522
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,440
Kremlin and you know talk about peace as

523
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,100
if that person from politburo means

524
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,520
anything in in peace movement

525
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,220
self-delusion is is the most predominant

526
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,020
phenomenon among these people Ramesh

527
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,799
Chandra is is a very shrewd

528
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,760
politician who

529
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,840
takes advantage of naive misguided

530
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,280
idealistically minded sometimes sincere

531
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,360
people

532
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,960
but he is I I would my impression is

533
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,059
that he's totally sold himself to the

534
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,720
Soviets he receives his payments or

535
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,580
royalties or whatever you can call it in

536
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,260
the form of prizes

537
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,940
of course it's very embarrassing if you

538
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,340
if you if you approach a person of his

539
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,799
caliber with money with cash and say

540
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,720
here comrador mesh Chandra there is a

541
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,360
money for your propaganda in the

542
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,159
interests of the Soviet Union

543
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,340
it's very unpolite so instead the Soviet

544
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
Union creates artificial International

545
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,740
bodies such as jabaharlal nehru peace

546
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,020
committee which consists of various

547
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,260
Progressive leaders writers sometimes

548
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,380
they're they're known figures and as

549
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,120
philosophers educationalists

550
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,860
sometimes they probably feel that

551
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,080
if there's no other possibility to

552
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
express the desire for peace at least

553
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,419
there is some legitimate overt activity

554
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,280
where they can express themselves that's

555
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,860
okay and they think they are too smart

556
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,100
not to see that part of it is Soviet

557
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,919
propaganda okay we are smart we are not

558
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,200
going to allow them to use us for

559
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,779
propaganda purposes this is wishful

560
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,120
thinking because after five or six

561
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,940
visits visits to USSR everything is paid

562
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,260
by the Soviet Government after

563
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,980
spending several vacations on a black

564
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,580
seed cost luxurious atmosphere with two

565
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,520
or three nice girls interpreters lots of

566
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,260
vodka and caviar books published that is

567
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,520
in the United States all of a sudden

568
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,279
published in millions of copies in USSR

569
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,600
in various languages

570
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,880
that tickles their ego they think they

571
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,820
are some somebody's all of a sudden

572
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,419
it's difficult to resist the temptation

573
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:10,980
Ramesh Chandra is exactly that type of

574
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,440
Personality he was approached at the

575
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,320
very early stage

576
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,279
and he didn't have willpower

577
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,580
and moral principles to resist the

578
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,799
temptation to resist the approach and by

579
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,120
now he's he's just upon in the game

580
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,940
high-ranking Capone and

581
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,880
uh if he is dismissed or dies natural

582
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,220
death there will be another the line of

583
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,900
people who would like to take his place

584
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,840
yes kgbtx very active part in the in the

585
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,360
peace movement

586
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,880
and if these people were sincere as they

587
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,460
say they are they would start

588
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,279
demonstrating him Kremlin or I mean in

589
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,760
Red Square not in Washington DC or in in

590
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,100
the Central Park in New York or in Los

591
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,140
Angeles but they don't have courage they

592
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,059
don't have guts to go to Russia and

593
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,400
protest against the nuclear Armament of

594
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,179
the Soviet Union therefore

595
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,340
I agree that they are misguided but I

596
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,320
think they are cowards

597
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,620
they're unprincipled dishonest people

598
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,380
and there's no justification that they

599
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,260
are misguided or poorly informed it's

600
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,120
their fault that they're pulling from

601
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,100
there's enough information

602
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,679
there's enough possibility in case of

603
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,179
United States sitting there's enough

604
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,940
freedom to do what Their Consciousness

605
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,940
should tell them to do go to Russia and

606
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,860
protest against Harmony

607
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,440
it doesn't take much courage to to to

608
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,480
take part in demonstration in Los

609
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,440
Angeles

610
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
but if you're really genuinely concerned

611
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,760
about peace

612
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,520
tell it to Brezhnev tell it to unblock

613
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,159
and we'll see how courageous and sincere

614
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,720
you are they don't do it

615
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,480
all the greatest strength I think is is

616
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,400
the basic principle of American

617
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,820
democracy common sense

618
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,039
and the uh

619
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,220
the value of of the principles of

620
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,500
private property and and respect to

621
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,900
human dignity and individual individual

622
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,260
rights the weakness is

623
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,140
the permissiveness and lack of moral

624
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,880
stamina

625
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
which if you are a religious person

626
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,520
could be could be interpreted as

627
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,640
probably alienation from religion

628
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,460
alienation from God

629
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,460
thinking too much in materialistic terms

630
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,460
thinking in short span

631
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,039
I'm for pragmatic

632
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,940
advantages

633
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,900
disregarding the

634
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,380
perspective of civilization some

635
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,840
philosopher I forget his name I was a

636
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,900
bad student in Moscow said that the

637
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,960
level of civilization is

638
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,140
in direct proportion to the time span

639
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,559
that human being thinks in in future for

640
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,880
future

641
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,159
the least civilized people live today

642
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,980
this minute the more civilized Nations

643
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,559
thing about tomorrow 10 years from now

644
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,820
100 years from now

645
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,740
this is one of the definitions of

646
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,080
unfortunately Americans are made to

647
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,500
think in shorter and shorter time span

648
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,460
terms

649
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,919
this is the greatest weakness

650
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,880
it is so therefore enjoy life and

651
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,779
Make Love Not work

652
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,360
I I think that

653
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,539
willpower and revitalization of

654
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,700
traditional moral values and principles

655
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
is the most desirable thing now today

656
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,740
the the sooner the better

657
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,899
the things that the principles and

658
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,520
values

659
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,580
on which the affluence and success of

660
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,580
American civilization depends and based

661
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,419
upon should be immediately civil uh

662
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:11,159
revitalized and brought back to school

663
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,399
programs to media and let's face it

664
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,380
propaganda I'm not afraid of this word

665
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,740
unlike the left liberal journalists who

666
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,480
think oh well it's propaganda I don't

667
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,899
see anything wrong in propagating the

668
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,960
basic moral principles and values on

669
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,940
which America is built

670
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,159
willpower

671
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,340
faith unshakable faith that this country

672
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,860
this civilization is right

673
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,980
and the enemy is wrong

674
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,440
no amount or no number of nuclear

675
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,559
warheads and and no size of the army

676
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,100
will will help United States to survive

677
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,080
whether there's nuclear war or

678
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,740
conventional Warfare Vietnam proved very

679
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,059
clearly

680
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,220
that with all the technology with all

681
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,679
the supersonic bombers and not power and

682
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,279
whatnot electronic gadgets and and cold

683
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,020
beer and Coca-Cola

684
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,899
you cannot defeat an enemy

685
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,559
unless you are fighting and have faith

686
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,559
in the righteousness of your fight

687
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,600
so that's the most urgent thing I think

688
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,779
wake up and and convince yourself that

689
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,580
you're on the right side

690
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,740
there should not be no neutralize more

691
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,860
object objectivity or objectivity is

692
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,120
good when you are discussing

693
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,279
philosophical Concepts

694
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,220
in today's world if you are neutral you

695
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,100
are already an enemy of your own country

696
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,039
you have to actively take part of your

697
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,799
country your side one of the reasons of

698
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,559
my defection is that I took sight I was

699
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,700
I was decided to take part to take

700
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,820
choice to make my own personal choice

701
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,039
for some strange reason today it's very

702
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,600
fashionable it considered to be an

703
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,059
intellectual sheet not to take sides

704
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,399
academic media

705
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,320
academic circles

706
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,039
Hollywood stars and politicians

707
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,720
they think it's very fashionable it's

708
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,100
intellectual to be non-alive

709
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,760
non-committed

710
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,980
neutral it's it's not intellectual it's

711
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,720
suicidical

712
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
laughs

713
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,740
suicidal

714
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,000
okay I'll start with the short

715
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,340
explanation I'm going to show you some

716
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,760
slides now the things that you're going

717
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,860
to see uh there's nothing new actually

718
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,260
they're they're reproduction from

719
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,120
various media organs in the United

720
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,360
States USSR probably you'll see these

721
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
pictures hundred times a day

722
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,020
I'm going to give you a very a different

723
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,779
viewpoint on the same thing same facts

724
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,460
that you see and probably don't don't

725
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,880
take much trouble to understand and

726
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,279
think what you are seeing

727
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,640
uh I don't know if you heard my

728
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,940
introduction I'm I'm a ideological

729
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,899
subverter yes from Russia okay

730
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,779
okay it's the idea of showing the slides

731
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,419
to you is just to provoke questions in

732
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,279
your mind and later on if you still have

733
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,620
patience with me I I will explain how

734
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,200
exactly the system of ideological in

735
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,159
indoctrination and um subversion works

736
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,200
well we know that we are living in a

737
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,419
time of peace and we know that recent

738
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,600
walkout from the Geneva Talks by the

739
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,440
Soviets is centered around the nuclear

740
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,860
arms and Rockets we don't see much about

741
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,720
the Soviet prepared as a Soviet

742
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,840
viewpoint on the military strategy well

743
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,899
this is a selection of pictures only

744
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,120
pictures Confucius said that one Picture

745
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,820
Tells more than thousand words these

746
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,220
pictures are from everyday newspapers in

747
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,260
USSR this is what the Soviet citizen

748
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,280
looks

749
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,540
in looks upon every day

750
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,280
basically this is a militaristic spirit

751
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,500
a pictures of foreign delegates

752
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,300
observing the Rockets passing the Red

753
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Square the idea of invasion unlike in

754
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,280
the United States is not being

755
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,760
criticized by the Soviet media at all on

756
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,280
the contrary it's being forcefully

757
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,699
encouraged from the age of say five or

758
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,399
six years six years old every Soviet

759
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,060
student's a student or Schoolboy has to

760
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,599
go through military training uh this is

761
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,599
a picture from a special military school

762
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,119
where young kids well maybe four or five

763
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,820
years old are being trained to be future

764
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,280
officers of the Soviet Army that's what

765
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,679
they do when they grow up these are the

766
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,520
Soviet Sailors Navy uh officers in a

767
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,740
foreign country we criticize a lot

768
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,320
American presence in foreign countries

769
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,660
but we never criticize and we never pay

770
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,520
too much attention about these planes

771
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,079
landing with the ammunition and

772
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,800
firearms in say countries like Ethiopia

773
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,240
these are the pictures in Time Magazine

774
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,680
which probably you've seen and then

775
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,480
forgotten about it these are the Soviet

776
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,000
tanks on foreign territory are there any

777
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,180
protest demonstrations in the Los

778
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,599
Angeles or New York City no

779
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,940
these are the Soviet military advisers

780
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,180
nobody tells them Russians go home how

781
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,520
it starts the media obviously plays a

782
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,859
great role this is a political cartoon

783
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,859
from a western newspaper

784
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,020
um you see it was published sometimes

785
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,900
after the second world war these four

786
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,260
Columns of Peace pay attention to whom

787
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,800
they are being erected Roosevelt on the

788
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,140
left Churchill on the Right End Stalin

789
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,960
in the middle a peacemaker Stalin

790
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,579
okay this is another thing Chicago

791
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,720
Tribune January 1945

792
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,740
Destiny's Child

793
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,400
New Year 45 is born look who is looking

794
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,859
with with love and affection

795
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:22,160
Churchill Roosevelt and Stalin

796
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,480
and this is how the Soviet media

797
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,060
describes Churchill as a warmonger

798
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,260
is Gustavo Moscow 1951 this is how the

799
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,660
Soviet media presents American

800
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,859
militarism linked with Nazism

801
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:45,740
this is how the Soviet media

802
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,200
illustrates South African colonialism

803
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,540
not much different from a political

804
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,400
cartoon in New York Times or Los Angeles

805
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,240
Times a matter of fact almost similar

806
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,520
growth of inflation due to military

807
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,400
expenses

808
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,680
a political cartoon from Prague the

809
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,960
newspaper it could be published as it is

810
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,480
in Los Angeles Times nobody would wander

811
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,540
NATO is criticized by the Soviet media

812
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,859
but so it is by the American Media Law

813
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,980
and Order justifying the former military

814
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,820
criminals this picture this is what is

815
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,460
uh this this is a number of books which

816
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,740

827
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,579
books which are included in the list of

edited myself when I was working for

840
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,460
novelty in Moscow

841
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,660

842
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,339
doesn't say much unless I explain what

843
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:41,640
it is these are the Seals attached to

crates of books imported from USSR to

845
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,740
Montreal as you can easily see the seal

846
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,579
is unbroken which means that the customs

847
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,980
in Canada didn't bother to see what's

848
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,500
inside and as I know from my personal

849
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,960
experience we used to import machine

850
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,440

editor's choice

861
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,960
why on bottom of the list these are the

862
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,420

these are the books which for some

871
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,780
strange reason Americans are denied the

872
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,579
freedom and right to read why America is

873
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,079

00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,760
description how drugs penetrate into

881
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,880
Western Society originated in communist

882
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
world for some strange reason that

883
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,140
textbook is never included in in the

884
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,599

Czechoslovakia explaining the tactics of

890
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,619
subversion for some strange reason it

891
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,300
was not published in the United States

892
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,760
or Canada the author had to pay for the

893
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,640
publication himself after defecting to

894
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,640
to the West this is another interesting

895
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,800
example

896
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,140
exoneration and ultimate and written by

897
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,079
Richard Romer a science fiction novel

898
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,720
about invasion of United States into

899
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,260
Canada to expropriate the oil and

900
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,000
natural gas resources in that

901
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,520
neighboring friendly Nation why it took

902
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,040
Invasion I don't understand 51 or more

903
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,920
percent of the of the companies are

904
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,500
already belong to the United States in

905
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,560
Canada is probably you know already who

906
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,720
is the author Richard Roemer is a

907
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,200
dynamic and dedicated exponent of the

908
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,300
needs of potential and so anyway he's a

909
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,740
friend of Pierre Trudeau a former of a

910
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,160
former military officer

911
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,520
and what he writes is is something that

912
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,800
andropo probably would be very happy

913
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,060
about

914
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,940
he describes a situation when the only

915
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,740
thing that saves Canada from United

916
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,160
States military occupation is a call

917
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,280
from andropos to the president of United

918
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,480
States threatening him with the re with

919
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,780
the reply or with the military answer to

920
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,359
an invasion of Canada by United States

921
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,119
and this is written by a close friend of

922
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,220
Pierre Trudeau a politician a former

923
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,500
military man why

924
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,260
is he a paranoid or am I a paranoid

925
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,460
the three books published almost

926
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,339
simultaneously

927
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:29,220

nobody is poisoning him with with the

940
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,680
poison umbrella this is uh you know who

941
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,800
uh he's criticizing CIA for developing a

942
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,280
gun to kill communist agents and he

943
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,099
tries to present it as a crime on behalf

944
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,319
of the United States intelligence agency

945
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,079
why is it a crime

946
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,420
to defend you from the Communist agents

947
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,760
and to develop a secret gun which is

948
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,720
silent

949
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,640
is a crime

950
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,760
is there any logic I don't see any this

951
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,740
is the fellow who also criticizes the

952
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,079
the United States CIA for developing

953
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,619
technical means of bagging United's I

954
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,260
mean USSR embassies on the territory of

955
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,380
United States why not

956
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,200
I don't see any reason why not but

957
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,060
Mondale obviously does he knows better

958
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,280
these are the authors who publish lists

959
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,680
of American agents stationed all over

960
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,020
the world they are alive

961
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,680
they actually they made quite a lot of

962
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,020
monies in the publication and this is

963
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,940
the victim

964
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,200
the chief of CIA in grief was killed

965
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,119
when the book of of the previous two

966
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,700
Americans was published

967
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,700
this fella is dead the other two are not

968
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,920
siberi in 1971 was visited by a group of

969
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,920
politicians from Canada and this this is

970
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,099
the report about that is it this is the

971
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:27,480
group we're shaking hands with the

972
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,760
Soviets uh ambassador

973
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,460
this is a Soviet technical Miracle a

974
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,060
pipeline on terma

975
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,319
thermafrost or something in other words

976
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,420
what Canadians were doing in early 60s

977
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,880
is presented to Canadian public as an

978
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,500
achievement a great technological

979
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,079
achievement in USSR

980
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,440
this is the root of their travel in

981
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,079
Siberia the Canadians covered that much

982
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,260
of distance please remember that map I

983
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,839
will come back to that question

984
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,599
this is a book published by a Canadian

985
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,940
author Farley Mobile by the way Never

986
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,420
Cry Wolf a movie which is made on the

987
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,540
basis of uh Farley mowatt's book he's a

988
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,280
nice fellow drinks a lot of vodka he was

989
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,380
a guest of novice depressed agency which

990
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,260
I was working for

991
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,540
this is another book written by Farley

992
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,180
Moet after returning from Siberia he was

993
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,460
accompanied by a person like myself a

994
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,839
novice depressed agency journalist

995
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:30,240
glorification of Siberia this is what an

996
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,180
L this is the root I promised you to

997
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,160
come back to that map which follow him

998
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,020
of it a Canadian Progressive writer

999
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,839
covered when he was in USSR

1000
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,240
this is what he makes Canadians to

1001
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,579
believe Siberia looks like it does of

1002
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,040
course Baikal lake is a very beautiful

1003
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,280
natural phenomenon a nicely dressed

1004
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,040
Soviet eskimosa I don't know some ethnic

1005
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,900
minorities friendly talking to each

1006
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,099
other in fluent English

1007
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,599
please

1008
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,160
they um

1009
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,099
nice nice Motel somewhere in the middle

1010
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,819
of Siberia

1011
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,480
a huge hydroelectric electrical projects

1012
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,579
it is true it is built but they never

1013
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,099
mentioned by whom

1014
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,400
and this is what I eventually wanted to

1015
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,880
show you these are the two Roots first

1016
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,060
one in red ink by Canadian government

1017
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,220
delegation

1018
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,000
in blue ink by the author Farley movers

1019
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,220
accompanied by novice depressed agency

1020
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,579
the black dots are locations of Soviet

1021
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,060
concentration camps

1022
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,000
these people were shown the places where

1023
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,859
the slave labor is being used by the

1024
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:51,240
Soviet government if you call them

1025
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,220
government I call them Junta Mass

1026
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,040
murderers but there is not a single

1027
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,440
mentioning not a word

1028
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,680
that those beautiful electric stations

1029
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,339
were built by slave slave labor

1030
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:08,460
this is what Canadian reader will never

1031
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,740
see in the report by Canadian

1032
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,060
politicians

1033
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,780
or the progressive writer Farley moment

1034
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,240
you say well that's that's Russia this

1035
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,040
is not a kindergarten this is a prison

1036
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,660
for children of prisoners

1037
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,960
these are the houses

1038
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,480
if if an American contractor would build

1039
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,980
a house like that

1040
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,400
I think he will end up in jail but this

1041
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,420
is what what is being shown to to some

1042
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,220
naive foreigners as achievements of

1043
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,500
Soviet technology naturally

1044
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,319
if you follow the editor's choice and

1045
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,740
advice you will never understand

1046
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,260
that the description the the most

1047
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,819
detailed description of Soviet

1048
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:56,520
concentration camp system

1049
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,040
is put on the on the bottom of the list

1050
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,920
you say well maybe in USSR the

1051
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,839
Concentration Camp is nothing surprising

1052
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,940
well this is a concentration camp in

1053
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,720
Southeast Asia

1054
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,359
in Cambodia

1055
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,579
same thing

1056
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,880
slave labor this is what happens to

1057
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,460
slave laborers when they don't obey the

1058
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,680
orders they are being executed not by

1059
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,660
firing squad because bullets are too

1060
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,680
expensive by showers crashing skulls

1061
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,060
this is the victory of Communism for you

1062
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,480
this is what happens to their children

1063
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,540
and this is the originator of this sloth

1064
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,119
house conversion Premiere Paul Potts

1065
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,880
during interview with Time Magazine very

1066
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,220
nice plump fatherly image

1067
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,680
you're made to believe that Holocaust

1068
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,859
happened during the second world war is

1069
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,079
something that may

1070
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,260
happen again it may

1071
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,200
but the originator of it may not

1072
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,599
necessarily be the Nazis

1073
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,180
we don't have any Nazi submarines

1074
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,040
roaming around the shores of United

1075
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,319
States and Canada

1076
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,500
we have Liberation forces that's what

1077
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,579
Holocaust this is happening right now

1078
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:25,500
after the so-called National Liberation

1079
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,079
movement this is a as a steal from a

1080
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,540
movie Holocaust a television production

1081
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,420
the Nazis are shooting the Prisoners the

1082
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,780
Jews

1083
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,920
we are made to well it's horrible of

1084
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,960
course there is no denial it happened

1085
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,060
many years ago

1086
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,180
and the tactic which I will explain you

1087
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,520
later if you have patience with me is

1088
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,099
side tracking your opinion from present

1089
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,480
danger to the Past

1090
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:58,319
from this this is present time

1091
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,839
this is past time

1092
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:02,940
this is happening right now

1093
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,760
in Asia Africa and Latin America is

1094
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,380
there any movie about Holocaust with

1095
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,200
Shepherds now no

1096
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,900
this is what happens in there for well

1097
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,760
it did happen in Rhodesia before it

1098
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,619
becomes Zimbabwe

1099
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,599
it's a black girl by the way not a white

1100
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,839
one

1101
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,440
this is the result of the Socialist

1102
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,760
movement

1103
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,740
these people were killed by those who

1104
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,380
are now in power in Zimbabwe and we call

1105
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,940
them Reverend

1106
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,200
Bishops or whatever

1107
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:39,000
this is the supply of Soviet arms to

1108
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,440
religion before it turned into Zimbabwe

1109
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,020
and this is very interesting picture the

1110
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,579
poor South African is showing his

1111
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,500
internal passport saying that there is

1112
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,400
no

1113
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,440
freedom

1114
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,260
and he has to live whatever he is

1115
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,480
assigned to live by the police for some

1116
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,720
strange reason not a single media Outlet

1117
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,300
in the United States makes comparison

1118
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,700
because in Russia every citizen have a

1119
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,540
prospect like that

1120
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:12,240
and the Asian ethnics in USSR do not

1121
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,339
have the right to live in those areas

1122
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:15,960
which are designed for the for the

1123
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,780
whites and the other way around

1124
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,940
but we are getting emotional about this

1125
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,800
password why not about sovereign

1126
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,040
is flowing in the wind how the same room

1127
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,980
okay the the feeling of guilt open any

1128
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,720
magazine there are lots of pictures like

1129
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,400
that hungry people asking for your

1130
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,599
dollar donation think about it Emma de

1131
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,940
Leon has no one else to turn to except

1132
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,800
you

1133
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,540
see how many pictures I collected them

1134
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,059
within one week

1135
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,119
and who helps them rock stars through

1136
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,339
United Nations UNICEF

1137
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,859
and how they use this money they buy

1138
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,720
arms

1139
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,579
have you noticed that countries like

1140
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:01,380
Philippines never ask for the Nations

1141
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,240
why because they have free market system

1142
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,359
oh yes they have military dictatorship

1143
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,339
oppression of civil rights but for some

1144
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:10,380
strange reason only those countries

1145
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,900
which are already liberated by marxists

1146
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,260
are asking for your donations why and

1147
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,079
when they get these donations

1148
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,500
will you be my friend this is what Time

1149
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,319
Magazine wants you to think if not the

1150
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,720
implication is this is what's going to

1151
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,720
happen

1152
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,700
when white miners stationed in this

1153
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,920
small country African country were

1154
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,240
murdered by so-called National

1155
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,980
Liberation movements

1156
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,319
this is the result rape and murder

1157
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,920
after your donations

1158
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,900
and who is who is supporting these

1159
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,819
movements of course United

1160
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,599
Nations

1161
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,240
okay we'll we'll come later on to the

1162
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,859
question of semantic manipulation

1163
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,200
everybody knows that United Nation is

1164
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,599
not United and it's not Nations but we

1165
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,599
continually

1166
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,319
I don't know how many people notice the

1167
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,319
Striking similarity between the emblem

1168
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,300
of United Nations and emblem of this of

1169
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,559
the USSR you think it's coincidence

1170
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,400
the symbolism is obvious unless you are

1171
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,480
blind of course we

1172
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,579
I'm the creator of the United Nation

1173
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:32,099

1178
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,300

United States a former Soviet spy

1181
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,460
well you know this guy is Daniel

1182
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,800
Ellsberg he published secret papers of

1183
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,559
Pentagon why not of Soviet military

1184
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,900
industrial complex

1185

he's a respected citizen of the United

1186
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,420
States

1187
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,280
Dr Spock Agony of Vietnam

oh yeah

1190
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,420
how how many men has to die before they

1191
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,700
understand that I don't remember the the

1192
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,500
lyrics of the song but it was very

1193
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,359
impressive song When I was a Soviet

1194
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,220
student I almost cried when I listened

1195
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,079
to that and I thought my God what a nice

1196
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,599

00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,700
Hollywood

00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,200
did she ever defend both people

1204
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,680
did she say a word in defense

1205
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,660
Vietnamese let's say about horrors of

1206
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,680
coming out of this no she's busy here

1207
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,520
preaching the

1208
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,720
health or whatever

1209
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,480
and also she takes part in demonstration

1210
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,900
against South and South African racism

1211
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:27,980
not about this

1212
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,240
and not about this

1213
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,099
this is Liberation movement Warriors

1214
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,800
Jane Fonda didn't say anything about

1215
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,300
that racism a black killed by blacks

1216
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,200
simply because he is anti-communist

1217
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,680
there's just a symbolic picture okay now

1218
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,079
next thing I'm going to show you some

1219
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,420
slides which are

1220
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,920
also not nothing Sensational but may

1221
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,859
provoke some questions in your mind

1222
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,700
maybe not

1223
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,559
okay

1224
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,300
the more questions you have the better

1225
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,400
because we will come to systematic

1226
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,160
explanation of of the phenomenon later

1227
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,559
now I want you just to get excited

1228
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,680
uh Hollywood actress talking to Fidel

1229
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,140
Castro nothing wrong of course depends

1230
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,420
what is the message or what's the

1231
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,760
subject of talking

1232
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,000
foreign

1233
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,240
he's an American singer Dean Reed

1234
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,460
he's singing in Moscow for some strange

1235
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,200
reason and you know what he's singing

1236
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,059
about

1237
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:48,420
oppression civil rights uh in in USA and

1238
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:54,440
about poor Americans who cannot survive

1239
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,960
well I don't want to be too critical of

1240
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,079
of

1241
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,099
pope of Catholic church but some states

1242
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,859
statements which he made at the earlier

1243
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,760
years of his

1244
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,119
becoming a appointee for Catholic Church

1245
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,859
strikingly unpleasant to me communism

1246
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:21,319
and church can coexist can they

1247
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,380
well you should ask a Russian Orthodox

1248
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,559
priests who were literally

1249
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:31,680
exterminated by by the Soviet Communists

1250
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,839
communism church can pre-exist I don't

1251
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,480
think so Catholic times I I collected

1252
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,280
this newspaper

1253
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,380
in a Catholic Church which I attend

1254
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,800
although I'm Orthodox Christian as

1255
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,740
Russians most of them are

1256
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,300
but I do come to Catholic church because

1257
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,640
my wife is a Catholic so I don't see

1258
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,559
much difference because God that I

1259
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,619
suppose is one so Jesus Christ is also

1260
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,780
the same with which church whichever you

1261
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,099
go but

1262
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:00,960
Christians and socialism is something

1263
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,599
that doesn't really appeal to me I don't

1264
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,440
know how about you

1265
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:10,740
social justice Central to gospel is it I

1266
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,619
never heard about it

1267
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:16,319
join with marxists is from the same

1268
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,980
newspaper

1269
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,480
and that's how they joined it Marxist

1270
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,339
Nicaragua before Sandinista came to

1271
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,920
power a priest with machine gun behind

1272
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,180
his back and the Machine Gun of course

1273
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,980
know anything about machine guns okay

1274
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,260
then there are some strange deviations

1275
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,780
from religious uh

1276
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,099
um path uh what's his name John Jim

1277
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:44,900
Jones Reverend Reverend

1278
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,619
nice looking guy with adopted kids and

1279
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:51,440
shaking hands with the politician

1280
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,460
mayor George

1281
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,440
Moscone in 1976 very nice

1282
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,900
that's how it all ended you remember 900

1283
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,760
more than 900 people who poisoned

1284
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,280
themselves together with their kids in

1285
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,760
Guyana

1286
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:10,140
this is a very interesting picture it's

1287
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,940
not very clear instead of Jesus Christ

1288
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,400
they put a naked lady you know in the

1289
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,520
church

1290
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:18,359
stranger

1291
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,520
of course it's strange crucifix of a

1292
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,339
woman for pound Sunday

1293
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:25,680
boy Jesus Christ would turn in his grave

1294
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,700
if he were engraved

1295
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,119
now this this is something that also

1296
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,740
indicates some strange occurrences

1297
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,900
within the framework of organized

1298
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,480
religion in struggle a paper with

1299
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,119
Tamarind sickle published by a Canadian

1300
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,240
group of trotskyites very Dynamic

1301
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,700
extremely radical group they challenge

1302
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,980
the question whose democracy is this

1303
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,079
meaning the Canadian democracy is not

1304
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,540
democracy at all simply because that

1305
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,339
radical group is challenged by the local

1306
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:11,339
police right so nothing new we know

1307
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:12,299
about this

1308
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:15,540
but look where this paper is being

1309
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,940
distributed

1310
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,799
political repression Friday October

1311
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:26,299
but United Church

1312
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:28,680
stranger

1313
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,420
see this is the same leaflet

1314
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:35,960
enlarged

1315
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,660
this is another thing President Carter

1316
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,180
handed over an antique

1317
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,359
Crown belonged to church of Hungary to

1318
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,780
the present Communist Regime of Hungary

1319
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,480
why I don't understand to make them

1320
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,140
friendlier to church I doubt

1321
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,420
feminist movement I don't know how you

1322
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,760
feel about feminism I don't think that

1323
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,920
to be equal with men you have to

1324
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,559
politicize your movement you cannot

1325
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,579
legislate equality you have to be equal

1326
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:09,960
but that distracts your mind from real

1327
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,220
issues of family loyalty and and well if

1328
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,180
you

1329
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,299
the Moral Moral foundations and they

1330
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,240
make a great political capital on that

1331
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,400
first lady of the United States sitting

1332
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,740
to the to to some kind of I forget what

1333
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,799
what her name was exposing her tits to

1334
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,619
the media I mean this is

1335
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,440
and by by the soil by by the American

1336
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,900
Media standards this is something normal

1337
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,660
acceptable the first lady of the United

1338
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,339
States together

1339
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,799
with the lady who burns her

1340
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:48,480
bra I don't know well ladies in the army

1341
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,920
of course I don't know what's your

1342
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,920
opinion I I never heard about

1343
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,260
girls in the Soviet Army especially in

1344
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,140
the Infantry Force simply because when

1345
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,720
they have period That's that may create

1346
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,059
a problem for invasion of say

1347
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,780
Afghanistan

1348
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,980
homosexualism I I to be honest me

1349
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,660
personally I don't like the idea of

1350
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,220
homosexuality I think it's it's

1351
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,780
unhygienic

1352
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,160
but

1353
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,819
but uh homosexuality in the army

1354
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:29,040
making Heroes of them gays on the March

1355
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,720
why

1356
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,240
why to to have population in a natural

1357
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,420
manner deserves a public opinion uh

1358
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,680
attention

1359
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,980
and and the political force

1360
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,960
why to politicize something which

1361
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,359
doesn't belong to politics at all in

1362
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,460
Russian in the Soviet Union we have a

1363
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,859
joke don't mix politics and prostitution

1364
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:53,059
they are already mixed

1365
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,160
we know perfectly well this is the

1366
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,480
medical science proved that

1367
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,359
homosexuality leads to Distortion in in

1368
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,660
human psychology this fellow killed 15

1369
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,960
kids after molesting them sexually we

1370
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,900
know that most of the agents who were

1371
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,900
recruited by KGB including McLean and

1372
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,380
Guy Burgess were homosexual homosexuals

1373
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,920
but we are reading in in the media that

1374
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,859
this is some something acceptable more

1375
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:25,200
than that we are made to believe that

1376
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,859
these people deserve equal rights and

1377
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:31,520
respect

1378
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,940
well that again is a debatable question

1379
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,099
whether to like or not to like certain

1380
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:41,540
type of music me personally I don't

1381
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,400
this these two nice ladies one is

1382
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,960
younger the other is a little bit older

1383
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,819
both of them want it for some strange

1384
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:49,500
reason to shoot president of the United

1385
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,740
States defending the environment of the

1386
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,599
United States the green trees and

1387
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,819
vegetation

1388
01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:00,180
why it takes that of United States

1389
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,660
president to defend the the environment

1390
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,180
I I don't understand if you do please

1391
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,980
explain

1392
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,559
then of course glorifying all kind of

1393
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,400
National Liberation leaders we naturally

1394
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,339
provoke our own kids to go into some

1395
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:19,920
strange Liberation movement you know who

1396
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,020
I'm talking about this is the girl who

1397
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,359
was abducted by terrorists and then she

1398
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:26,520
became terrorists herself a daughter of

1399
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,640
a wealthy publisher

1400
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,339
naturally there are thousands millions

1401
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,900
of kids who

1402
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,319
Who Loved adored her courage

1403
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:40,020

Russian language to the likes of him

1407
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:50,400
that's the result of the activity when

1408
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,859
they come back home aldamora was killed

1409
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:55,799
by Red Army terrorists who were wanted

1410
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:58,260
to liberate Italians from something I

1411
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,359
don't know from whom

1412
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:04,079

01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,400
and this is a person who also liberates

1415
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,260
someone from someone I don't exactly

1416
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,859
know obviously Indians from whites in

1417
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:18,660
the United States but pay attention what

01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,760
he holds in his hand

1419
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,819

1420
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,160
heart I can put it apart with my eyes

1421
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,760
closed

1422
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,540
um war on terrorism does it exist

1423
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:37,040
apart from verbal War

1424
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,660
this is what I have collected on an a

1425
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,579
campus in Canada

1426
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,200
Carlton University

1427
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,119
Ottawa

1428
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:47,640
left-wing tabloids that's how they

1429
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,859
instill in the minds of people young

1430
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:53,520
people that to fight is the only way the

1431
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,460
violence death is the only way to

1432
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,859
achieve rights of Palestinian people

1433
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:01,400
other people Quebec

1434
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,680
separatists and jobs and peace obviously

1435
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,599
you cannot get job if you spend all your

1436
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,260
time walking up and down streets with

1437
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,000
posters like that you have to go to

1438
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,339
place with them where the jobs are

1439
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,920
and of course to find the job the the

1440
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,619
most unsuccessful way to find a job is

1441
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:25,680
to read papers like that

1442
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,480
I don't feel like working this is

1443
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,859
something another this is a Playboy

1444
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,299
magazine probably you heard the story

1445
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:33,420
about Larry Flynn how how successful is

1446
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,720
he to attract attention of media and and

1447
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,660
public opinion by doing crazy things

1448
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,839
getting involved in court case of of the

1449
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:44,160
um

1450
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,799
the car manufacturer why he wants to do

1451
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,140
it I don't know but what he does

1452
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:54,180
attracts some strange Mass attention

1453
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,339
Playboy magazine makes jokes about

1454
01:06:56,339 --> 01:06:58,260
Russian sex

1455
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,119
that's the image that they want to

1456
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:02,400
present to American people

1457
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,380
but they don't explain to American

1458
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,880
people that the process of

1459
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,059
demoralization is not as is not the

1460
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:11,579
question of joke

1461
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:14,700
this is Portugal after socialists came

1462
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,000
to power on your left is a prostitute

1463
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,420
who was imported from East Germany to

1464
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,559
Lisbon

1465
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,140
a communist prostitute in a country

1466
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,119
which which is

1467
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,220
just had its successful socialist

1468
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,859
Revolution very interesting what for to

1469
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:34,500
make money no I'll tell you later on the

1470
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,480
right pornographic literature in the

1471
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,460
country with strong Catholic moral

1472
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,059
principles

1473
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,839
well

1474
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:45,059
I don't know how many people of you like

1475
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,280
to drink alcohol I did

1476
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,099
but I noticed that some

1477
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,700
ads in in magazines have some strange

1478
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,760
desire to joke about alcohol

1479
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,400
and the jokes are closely related to

1480
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,280
justification of Soviet Russian presence

1481
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,380
a prominent Russian joined the Secret

1482
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,640
Service

1483
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,160
something to joke about while you drink

1484
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,839
Vodka

1485
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:13,859
I don't see any humor in that do you

1486
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:15,900
okay this this is a number of

1487
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,738
advertising of alcohol for which

1488
01:08:18,738 --> 01:08:21,420
Canadians get into hot water comes the

1489
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,880
revolution anyone can drink McGuinness

the picture of Cruiser Battleship Aurora

1492
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,460

this is a historical Relic in USSR the

1494
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:37,380
revolution communist Bolshevik

1495
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,080
Revolution started with the with the

1496
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,779
cannon fired from that battleship

1497
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:45,540
and obviously Soviet Embassy was

1498
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,000
insulted so they sent a protest note to

1499
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,819
Pure Trudeau and the picture was removed

1500
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:53,460
from the magazine when I was teaching at

1501
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,380
Carlton University in whatever my

1502
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,960
superiors forced me to do an IQ test

1503
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,020
with two groups of my students

1504
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,679
the idea was to answer about four um 100

1505
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:07,799
questions to give answer yes no or

1506
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:10,799
undecided the more undecided or negative

1507
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,259
answers you give the more according to

1508
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,299
the compilers of this test you are

1509
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:18,238
adaptable and useful to society

1510
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,060
the more positive answers you give the

1511
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,479
more questionable is your adaptability

1512
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:28,020
and and usefulness for for your country

1513
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,020
this is explanation how to score how to

1514
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,120
count the scores and now see the

1515
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,020
questions telling dirty joke is bad a

1516
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,660
good soldier is a patriot yes no or

1517
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,440
undecided

1518
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,420
think about it

1519
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,238
every communist should be run out of the

1520
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,299
country yes no or undecided

1521
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:53,399
the Bible is the greatest source of

1522
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,440
Truth

1523
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,179
right

1524
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:00,120
God is everywhere a person who kills

1525
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:04,140
another person is a murderer yes no or

1526
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,860
undecided

1527
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,600
okay now

1528
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,000
if you don't believe me come let's come

1529
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,340
back see I I want to repeat you once

1530
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,219
again the conditions of the scoring

1531
01:10:20,219 --> 01:10:23,340
the more undecided and negative answers

1532
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,719
you give

1533
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,080
the more you are adaptable and flexible

1534
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,780
and useful for the society

1535
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,520
do you understand what they are doing to

1536
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,040
kids okay they are doing two things at a

1537
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,060
time

1538
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,199
they teach them moral relativism

1539
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:43,080
they teach them how to light to get a

1540
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,420
greatest score because obviously a child

1541
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,159
would say if a person killed another

1542
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,260
person he is a murder but for the sake

1543
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:52,440
of getting a higher score obviously a

1544
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,800
student would put no or undecided so you

1545
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,500
teach your kid how to lie

1546
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,780
to be successful and to look adaptable

1547
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,000
and useful for society

1548
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,219
well obviously I had to do that test but

1549
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,820
I added one more question to that thing

1550
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,560
my own question I said what kind of

1551
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,780
society you are going to be useful to

1552
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:23,159
and

1553
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:26,400
most of my students give me an excellent

1554
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,860
answer they say a society where there is

1555
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,260
no moral principle nor respect to God

1556
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:34,500
love family and working ethics very

1557
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,640
simple they are not that stupid

1558
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,520
here we are comrade

1559
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,860
now this is the picture from a Soviet

1560
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,800
magazine obviously a Soviet media tries

1561
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,080
to project their leaders in the most

1562
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,380
respectful way very impressive very

1563
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,199
fatherly very serious person there is

1564
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,000
nothing surprising what else is new of

1565
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,980
course

1566
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,260
but this is Time Magazine an American

1567
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,420
Magazine

1568
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,219
the caption is not quite clear but it

1569
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:06,960
says basically that

1570
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,360
comrade bresner doesn't give interview

1571
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,360
to Time Magazine the message is clear

1572
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,420
he's a positive caretaking person he's

1573
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,940
too busy to take care of the world

1574
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,640
problems and the economical problems in

1575
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,340
Russia it's a very humorous caption but

1576
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,380
nevertheless the impact if you are not

1577
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,719
quite concerned about politics what is

1578
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,100
your impression about this nice

1579
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,980
gentleman

1580
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,159
nice smiling tired well

1581
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,920
and this is how media presents your

1582
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,340
leaders

1583
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,800
I I don't know whether

1584
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,080
he deserves to be presented like that or

1585
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,400
not this is a different question

1586
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,900
this is Prime Minister of Great Britain

1587
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,920

you may or may not like beetles me

1589
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,340
personally I don't like them

1590
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,719
but

1591
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,020
a prime minister of a country together

1592
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,219

1595
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,719
in all times was given only to the most

1596
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:36,900

1597
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,699

you know we had a saying in Russia that

1614
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,860
in all times

1615
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,820
clowns were entertaining the royalty

1616
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:46,440
today the mightiest of the world

1617
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,480
think it's a privilege to appear with

1618
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,520
entertainers

1619
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,920
just the reverse of the old principle

1620
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,320
you know they are the entertainers of

1621
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,719
entertainers

1622
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:00,659
because they want it for their political

1623
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:01,980
career

1624
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:06,260
Ed Kennedy dances in Moscow

1625
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,780

to to go to USSR why doesn't he occupy

1627
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,960
himself with something more relevant to

1628
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,420
the urging problems of the world

1629
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:21,120
he thinks he's going to be popular in

1630
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,280
America maybe but in Russia they look at

1631
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,060
him as a schmuck

1632
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,699

he thinks he's smart and he's something

1640
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,460
to to admire I bet the guys who are

1641
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,219
standing behind don't think this way at

1642
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:04,260
all while Kissinger just by mistake is

relations with Cuba despite the ER

1653
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,159
urge from the United States government's

1654
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:37,980

for a thing like that a prime minister

1667
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,719
would have to resign

1668
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,719
it's a shame for a nation

1670
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,100

01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:08,699
comrade breznick to stand up because the

1681
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:10,920
senile leader of Russia is unable to

1682
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,500
stand up without Western Aid

1683
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:28,080
oh you may you may say well it's best

1684
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,820
Germans they're too close to Russia

1685
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,340
probably they do it just in case

1686
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,100
okay here's the same thing Carter is

1687
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,900
helping the president of the mightiest

1688
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,420
Empire mightiest power in the in the

1689
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,940
world United States is helping comrade

1690
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,040
Brazil if you remember the incident when

1691
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,860
he the president almost stumbled down

1692
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:49,500
uh down the staircase somewhere in

1693
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,000
Vienna of course

1694
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,719
and thanks to to Carter he didn't fall

1695
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,640
uh Andrew Young is talking to a dictator

1696
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,239
in in Africa

1697
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,420
again

1698
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:08,340
uh McGovern I think is talking to

1699
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:11,159
augustino Neto a Soviet puppet in Luanda

1700
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:12,780
why

1701
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:15,060
is it that necessary to be friendly to

1702
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,360
smile to each other

1703
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,060
now we're coming to space from Earth to

1704
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:23,940
space clouds over the Space Program why

1705
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,140
clouds

1706
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,540
minded this is after three or four

1707
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:31,100
successful landing on moon

1708
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,140
why clouds

1709
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,020
okay here's two pictures left Soviet

1710
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,719
Cosmonaut walking into the Kremlin hall

1711
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:40,980
for for

1712
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,260
ceremonious reception on the right

1713
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,260
choose American cosmonof casually walk

1714
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,340
watching TV

1715
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:53,040
on the top Soviet politburo talking to

1716
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,080
the space pilots on orbit

1717
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,719
on the lower picture Lyndon Johnson with

1718
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,980
um I think that's Glenn

1719
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:08,159
an American spice without pilot

1720
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,679
now even if you don't know anything

1721
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:13,980
about the theory of information the

1722
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,480
comparison minded this is a French

1723
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,179
magazine it's not the Soviet propaganda

1724
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:20,460
the comparison of the size of the

1725
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:24,000
pictures gives you the message already

1726
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,699
what is more important

1727
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:30,000
what is more impressive

1728
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,880
here a picture from Soviet newspaper

1729
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,760
Pravda a Soviet school boy compares

1730
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,940
two replicas of I mean replicas of

1731
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:39,920
Soviet

1732
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,940
soyuz spacecraft and American Apollo

1733
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,199
friendship in Space the tongue right pay

1734
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:53,000
attention to the size of the spacecraft

1735
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:57,120
they are almost identical right

1736
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,260
now this is

1737
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,320
what the size almost actual size is the

1738
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,020
American spacecraft is on the left

1739
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,659
it's almost twice as big as the Soviet

1740
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:10,739
one

1741
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:12,380
right

1742
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,540
okay this is a Soviet picture

1743
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,699
this is an American picture with true

1744
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,620
sizes

1745
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,600
okay

1746
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,239
you say well Soviet media of course

1747
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,760
tries to diminish the successes of the

1748
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,760
American Space Program now this is an

1749
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,040
American Media

1750
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,520
on the left a Soviet

1751
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,300
moon walker or Soviet Probe on moon on

1752
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,179
the right side an American space

1753
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:44,280
Volkswagen as they say it actually was

1754
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,860
used on the surface of moon the sizes

1755
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,520
are almost identical right wrong

1756
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,340
the thing on the left is the size of a

1757
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:56,000
tea cattle

1758
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:01,280
in other words about 100 times smaller

1759
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,040
but Time Magazine does not explain it to

1760
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,120
the readers

1761
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,100
an average person in the United States

1762
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,140
has an impression

1763
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,780
that the junk on the left is as

1764
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,420
important and as successful

1765
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:19,280
as the as the Masterpiece of Technology

1766
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,360
produced by American mind and ingenuity

1767
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,239
okay you remember Sky lab

1768
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:29,400
there was a time when it just about to

1769
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,980
fall down on on United States or any

1770
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,900
other country and the Pentagon was very

1771
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,460
worried there were pictures there were

1772
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,159
discussions on TV some strange

1773
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,320
characters even started joking about it

1774
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,699
see the Skylab Target

1775
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,640
a lot of emotions expressed about the

1776
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,060
failure of United States Sky lab

1777
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,000
a lot of bitter opinions were expressed

1778
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,300
about about the unnecessary spending on

1779
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:00,560
on Space research

1780
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,840
but when Soviet nuclear-powered

1781
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,940
satellite following the territory of

1782
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,219
Canada there was no protest

1783
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:10,260
demonstrations there were nothing like

1784
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,179
that

1785
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:14,940
nowhere in the world ask yourself why

1786
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:17,640
according to some information this was

1787
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,580
not a satellite at all it was a flying

1788
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:23,400
atomic bomb

1789
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,440
Canadians spend something like 15

1790
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,320
million dollars just to find the junk on

1791
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,659
their own territory thanks God it felt

1792
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:33,719
in inhabited areas of of Canada in

1793
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:35,699
Northwest Territories where only

1794
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:38,100
penguins live or what if it fell on

1795
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,580
Toronto

1796
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,380
a flying nuclear bomb

1797
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:46,679
oh boy but no protests here Soviet

1798
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:49,280
Ambassador Anatoly dobrinim happily

1799
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,520
looking at the linking of American and

1800
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,520
Soviet spacecraft in where in in

1801
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,560
American

1802
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,260
Grounds Control Center

1803
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,980
this is a picture from Time Magazine

1804
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,719
this is also a picture from Time

1805
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,960
Magazine Soviet citizens are watching

1806
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:14,159
the same moment linking of spacecraft

1807
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,780
think about it

1808
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:19,080
compare here happiness

1809
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,900
on the right American representative of

1810
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,940
the NASA

1811
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:27,860
and the brillian very happy

1812
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,000
that's how ordinary Soviet citizens

1813
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,179
think about the farce in space

1814
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:35,820
they understand perfectly well that

1815
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,199
linking

1816
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,560
spacecraft in space

1817
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,260
is just a fake it doesn't mean anything

1818
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,940
look at their faces

1819
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:50,239
they are sad

1820
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:51,980
foreign

1821
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:56,659
was realized was it worth the price

1822
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,000
pessimistic question right after all the

1823
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,480
successes of American Space Program

1824
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,659
immediate the media tries to instill in

1825
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:08,820
your mind a doubt

1826
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,800
pessimism

1827
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,400
why

1828
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,340
oh this is a frog

1829
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,560
I don't know how much you know about

1830
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,800
frogs I'll tell you that a frog

1831
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,480
can see a mosquito only if it moves

1832
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:34,140
across this the area of its vision

1833
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,739
if a mosquito quietly sits on a grass

1834
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:42,199
blade the frog doesn't notice it

1835
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,320
that's the attitude of American Media

1836
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,679
they do not notice problem unless it

1837
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,620
moves and moves close to Hilton where

1838
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,460
they stationed

1839
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,560
these are the people

1840
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,780
who make

1841
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,659
file a suit against me if like if I call

1842
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:09,060
them Liars but that's exactly what they

1843
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:11,820
are they've been lying to you for years

1844
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:14,280
and years about the situation in Vietnam

1845
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,040
in Russia they were selling commercials

1846
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,440
the other risers and cars

1847
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,020
and they sold you a rotten information

1848
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,600
this information of what happens in the

1849
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,320
world

1850
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,139
they have a vision of frog

1851
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:31,320
but they look like semi-gods to you and

1852
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,000
if I challenge their credibility

1853
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,280
probably the people will call me a

1854
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,280
paranoid or a very nasty person I may be

1855
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,980
a nasty person but that's my opinion I

1856
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,600
was a person who used to take this

1857
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,000
people for a ride when I was working for

1858
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,400
the service side

1859
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,980
okay if you don't believe me here one of

1860
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,840
the most conservatives news conservative

1861
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,020
newspapers in this particular case it's

1862
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,400
a Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail

1863
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,500
editorial page

1864
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,440
nothing's nothing special right

1865
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,239
the malaise of liberal democracies

1866
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,800
saving Buddha former president of

1867
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,500
Pakistan called priority and then there

1868
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,080
is another article on the on the right

1869
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,199
here U.S how to dominate Pacific

1870
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,960
Russians claim well obviously somebody's

1871
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,940
opinion right

1872
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:28,340
nothing unusual for an average reader

1873
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,719
Russians claim that United States ought

1874
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,780
to dominate Pacific the idea is that

1875
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,520
while the United States is obviously

1876
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,260
aggressive and they want to dominate

1877
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,880
something and Russians are unhappy about

1878
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,719
it

1879
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:41,699
somebody says

1880
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:44,100
you read an article and

1881
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,199
probably you may agree or disagree but

1882
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:47,940
you have a feeling the message of

1883
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,139
urgency

1884
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:52,020
the nasty Americans again how to

1885
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,300
dominate Pacific

1886
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,060
now look who is the author Alexandra

1887
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:01,679
malishkin novelty press agency

1888
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,040
not a word who is Malaysian and what is

1889
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,199
novice depressed agency

1890
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,360
an average reader will accept this

1891
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,360
article as a legitimate overt expression

1892
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,780
of an ordinary journalist it is not an

1893
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:18,480
opinion it's a fabrication by an

1894
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,540
extension of KGB novice depressed

1895
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,400
agencies Organization for which I work

1896
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,000
for 12 years

1897
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,360
this is highest example of dishonesty

1898
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,820
and disinformation just one line more

1899
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:35,580
would explain to an average reader what

1900
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,679
is that that he is reading

1901
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,520
but alas there is no explanation

1902
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,560
now this is the monument to Mother

1903
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,960
Russia in former Stalingrad now it is

1904
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,280
Volga grad

1905
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,600
the

1906
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,020
the statue is designed to to instill

1907
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,300
feeling of patriotism

1908
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,159
and um

1909
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,280
I don't know what else

1910
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,120
Pride maybe for the motherland

1911
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,699
these are the pictures of construction

1912
01:29:04,699 --> 01:29:08,460
uh High high-rise apartments in Moscow

1913
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,440
glorious achievement of Soviet

1914
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,600
technology

1915
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,880
caviar as an average

1916
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,520
some staple food of Russians

1917
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,100
these are the the minks and and Furs

1918
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,460
that Soviet citizens were

1919
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:27,780
you know

1920
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,120
that's how they look when they relax fat

1921
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,000
nice ladies you know

1922
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,480
you think it's Soviet propaganda

1923
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,239
no comrades

1924
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:41,340
this is also some Fashions latest

1925
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,340
fashions from Russia right from Kremlin

1926
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:48,260
for an average Soviet housewife

1927
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,940
well obviously it doesn't take much

1928
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,679
intelligence to understand that this is

1929
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,139
not quite true and obviously it has

1930
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,340
something to do with the Soviet

1931
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,880
propaganda

1932
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,639
the myths and the realities of the KGB

1933
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,280
is if you don't see the

1934
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,380
from Stalin to curse again the myth and

1935
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,900
the realities by Avril Harmon a former

1936
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,719
ambassador of the United States to USSR

1937
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,060
very complimenting article to the Soviet

1938
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,940
system

1939
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:20,639
and this is where it comes from you

1940
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,199
thought it was from a Soviet magazine

1941
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:26,699
right no it's from Luke magazine an

1942
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:28,920
American Magazine which published that

1943
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,280
crap

1944
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,840
if if you don't believe me I'll tell you

1945
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,260
that I was a person who accompanied a

1946
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,659
group of journalists from Luke magazine

1947
01:30:39,659 --> 01:30:41,940
when they came to Moscow on invitation

1948
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:45,000
from novice to press agency I made them

1949
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,800
to publish that thing

1950
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,500
for which I was awarded I received the

1951
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,540
bonus a free ticket to Italy for a week

1952
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,380
now this this is look like sheer

1953
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:04,199
high-class idiocy but unfortunately this

1954
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:06,659
is exactly what happened

1955
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:09,480
it it didn't took me much effort to

1956
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,120
convince the Americans to tell the

1957
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,739
American journalists from look magazine

1958
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:16,199
to bring back this magazine to dedicate

1959
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:18,440
the whole issue to the Glorious

1960
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,960
anniversary of Soviet Revolution

1961
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,000
[Music]

1962
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,780
this is what you were reading in your

1963
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,300
American Magazine

1964
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,920
this is how an average American

1965
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,159
perceived the Soviet way of life

1966
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:37,560
a happy Soviet citizens

1967
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,659
this is what an average girl in Russia

1968
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:40,980
wears

1969
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:44,040
this is what they eat and drink

1970
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,780
this is how they build their apartment

1971
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,940
houses

1972
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,560
and this is how they are fiercely

1973
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,420
patriotic

1974
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:54,300
amazing anyway so

1975
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,300
I will explain you how it all happens

1976
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,040
the last two pictures

1977
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,920
I will not commend I want you simply to

1978
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,219
look close into these eyes

1979
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,500
thank you this is the person who wants

1980
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,960
to liberate you wanted at least not

1981
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,340
anymore he's dead but there are many

1982
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,380
other people with the same type of eyes

1983
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,500
if I were a deeply religious person my

1984
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,080
answer to that picture would be these

1985
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,520
are the eyes

1986
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,639
of Satan

1987
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:32,719
he is

1988
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,020
nice power right

1989
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:40,560
United Nations celebrated back in 1969 I

1990
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,320
think the 100th anniversary of his

1991
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,060
birthday

1992
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,480
the greatest leader of mankind

1993
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,239
God forbid us to have leaders like that

1994
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:53,100
well that's all

1995
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,120
for that

1996
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:09,320
[Applause]

1997
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,239
subversion is the term if if you look in

1998
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:15,120
a dictionary or criminal code to that

1999
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,100
matter

2000
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,280
usually his ex is explained as a part of

2001
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,239
activity to destroy

2002
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:27,900
things like religion government system

2003
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,500
political economical system of a country

2004
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,040
and usually it's linked to Espionage and

2005
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,840
such romantic things as blowing up

2006
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,679
Bridges side tracking trains

2007
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:42,420
um clock and Dagger activity in

2008
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,159
Hollywood style

2009
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:45,480
uh

2010
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,540
when what I'm going to talk about now

2011
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,239
has absolutely nothing to do with the

2012
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:54,060
cliche of espionage

2013
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,159
or KGB activity of collecting

2014
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:57,840
information

2015
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,360
so the greatest mistake

2016
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,560
or mis misconception I think is that

2017
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,080
whenever we are talking about KGB for

2018
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,199
some strange reason

2019
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,420
starting from Hollywood Movie Makers to

2020
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:15,420
professors of political science and

2021
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,239
quote unquote experts on on Soviet

2022
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,699
Affairs or criminologists as they call

2023
01:34:20,699 --> 01:34:21,840
themselves

2024
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,719
they think that the most desirable thing

2025
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,540
for andropov and the whole KGB is to

2026
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:31,080
steal blueprints of some supersonic jet

2027
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:34,320
bring it back to Soviet Union and

2028
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,300
sell it to the Soviet military

2029
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,639
industrial complex

2030
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:43,139
it's only partly true if if we take the

2031
01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:45,900
whole time money

2032
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:49,739
and Manpower that the Soviet Union and

2033
01:34:49,739 --> 01:34:52,500
KGB in particular spans

2034
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,620
outside of USSR border

2035
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,719
we will discover of course there are no

2036
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,120
official statistics unlike with CIA or

2037
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:05,400
FBI the the Espionage as such

2038
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:09,900
occupies only 10 to 15 percent

2039
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:15,980
of money time and Manpower 15 percent

2040
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:19,139
of the activity of KGB

2041
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:21,239
first 85 percent

2042
01:35:21,239 --> 01:35:23,639
is always

2043
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:25,560
subversion

2044
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,199
and unlike a dictionary of English

2045
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:31,199
Oxford dictionary subversion in Soviet

2046
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,840
terminology means always a destructive

2047
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:38,340
aggressive activity aimed to destroy

2048
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:41,400
the country Nation or geographical area

2049
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,800
of your enemy

2050
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,480
so there's no Romantics in there

2051
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,520
absolutely no blowing up Bridges no

2052
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,100
microfilms in Coca-Cola cans nothing of

2053
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,940
that sort no James Bond nonsense

2054
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,840
it's most of this activity is overt

2055
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,120
legitimate

2056
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,580
and easily observable if you give

2057
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:06,540
yourself time and trouble to observe it

2058
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:10,020
but according to the law and and law

2059
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,580
enforcement systems of the western

2060
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:15,480
civilization it's not a crime exactly

2061
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:18,239
because of misconception manipulation of

2062
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:21,000
terms we think that subverter is a

2063
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,100
person who is going to blow up our

2064
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,960
beautiful bridges

2065
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,320
no subverter is a student who come for

2066
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:32,460
exchange a diplomat an actor an artist a

2067
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:36,780
journalist like myself was 10 years ago

2068
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,860
now subversion

2069
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:45,120
is an activity which is a two-way

2070
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:46,139
traffic

2071
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:49,199
you cannot subvert an enemy which

2072
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:52,199
doesn't want to be subverted

2073
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:55,320
if you know history of Japan for example

2074
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,100
before 20th century Japan was a closed

2075
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,300
Society

2076
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,120
the moment a foreign boat comes to the

2077
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:05,820
shores of Japan the Imperial Japanese

2078
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,440
Army politely tell them to get lost

2079
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,300
and if American salesman comes to the

2080
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:15,179
shore of Japan let's say 60 or 70 years

2081
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:18,239
from now back and says oh I have a very

2082
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,820
beautiful vacuum cleaner for you no with

2083
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:23,820
the good financing it says please leave

2084
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,580
us with the media vacuum cleaner

2085
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,820
if they don't leave they shoot them

2086
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:32,840
to preserve their culture ideology

2087
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,940
Traditions values intact

2088
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,520
you were not able to subvert Japan

2089
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,620
you cannot subvert Soviet Union because

2090
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:46,679
the borders are closed the media is

2091
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:48,600
censored by the government the

2092
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,300
population is controlled by the KGB and

2093
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,040
internal police

2094
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,900
with all the beautiful glossy pictures

2095
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,360
of Time Magazine and magazine America

2096
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,360
which is published by by the American

2097
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,239
Embassy in Moscow you cannot subvert

2098
01:38:03,239 --> 01:38:05,100
Soviet citizens because the magazine

2099
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,920
never reaches Soviet citizens

2100
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,620
it's collected from the new stance and

2101
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:13,620
thrown to garbage can

2102
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,800
subversion can be only successful when

2103
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,699
the initiator the actor the act the

2104
01:38:20,699 --> 01:38:22,620
agent of subversion

2105
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,239
has

2106
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,580
a responsive Target

2107
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,860
it's a two-way traffic

2108
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,800
United States is a receptive Target of

2109
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,460
subversion

2110
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,520
there is no response

2111
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,340
similar to that one from United States

2112
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,139
to the Soviet Union

2113
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:45,239
it stops halfway somewhere it never

2114
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:47,580
reaches here

2115
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:50,100
the theory of subversion goes all the

2116
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,199
way back

2117
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:54,060
2500 years ago

2118
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,820
the first human being

2119
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,460
who formulated the tactics of subversion

2120
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:02,520
was a Chinese philosopher by the name of

2121
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,300
Sansa

2122
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:13,219
two 3 500 years BC

2123
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,780
it was an advisor

2124
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:18,840
for several Imperial courts in ancient

2125
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,400
China

2126
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,639
and he said after long meditation

2127
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:25,080
that

2128
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,760
to implement

2129
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:30,239
foreign to implement State policy

2130
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,699
in a warlike manner

2131
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:34,400
it's the most

2132
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,659
counterproductive barbaric and

2133
01:39:36,659 --> 01:39:41,000
inefficient to fight on a Battlefield

2134
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,260
you know that war is continuation of

2135
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,000
State policy right so if you want

2136
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,800
successfully to implement your state

2137
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,060
policy

2138
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,100
and you start fighting this is the most

2139
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:53,940
idiotic way to do it the highest Arc of

2140
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:59,159
warfare is not to fight at all

2141
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:02,400
but to subvert anything of value in the

2142
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,040
country of your enemy until such time

2143
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,739
that the perception of reality of your

2144
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,780
enemy is screwed up to such an extent

2145
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:12,239
that he does not perceive you as an

2146
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:15,300
enemy and that your system

2147
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,980
your civilization and your for ambitions

2148
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:23,639
look to your enemy as an alternative if

2149
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:28,139
not desirable then at least feasible

2150
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:31,679
better red than dead

2151
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,679
that's the ultimate purpose the final

2152
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:36,600
stage of subversion after which you can

2153
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,760
simply take your enemy without a single

2154
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,679
shot being fired

2155
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:43,560
if the subversion is successful this is

2156
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,960
basically what subversion is

2157
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,980
as you see not the single mentioning of

2158
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:51,360
blowing up bridges of course Sansa

2159
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,639
didn't know about blowing up Bridges

2160
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:55,320
maybe there were not that many bridges

2161
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,400
at that time

2162
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,400
but

2163
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,020
but a subversion is being taught to

2164
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:07,739
every student of KGB School in USSR and

2165
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:10,800
to offices of military academies

2166
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,500
I'm not sure if the same author is

2167
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,560
included in the list of reading for

2168
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,960
American officers

2169
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,000
to say nothing about ordinary students

2170
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,860
of political science

2171
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,199
I had difficulty to find the translation

2172
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:28,620
of sunset in in the library of a

2173
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:31,440
university in Toronto and later on here

2174
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,480
in Los Angeles

2175
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,480
but it's a it's a book which is not

2176
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,860
available

2177
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,980
it is forced to every student in USSR

2178
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:44,159
every student who is who is thought to

2179
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,440
be dealing further in in his future

2180
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,619
career with foreigners

2181
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:52,380
what subversion is basically it consists

2182
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,900
of four periods

2183
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,440
time wise if we start from here and go

2184
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,480
this way time right this is the

2185
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,580
beginning point the first stage of

2186
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,800
subversion is the process which is

2187
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,040
called basically demoralization

2188
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,840
says for itself what it is

2189
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,980
it takes from

2190
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:22,080
say 15

2191
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:27,060
to 20 years to demoralize a society

2192
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,820
why why 15 or 20 years

2193
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:31,860
this is the time

2194
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:37,320
sufficient to educate one generation

2195
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:40,320
of students or children one generation

2196
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:44,159
one lifetime span of a person a human

2197
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:45,659
being

2198
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:48,360
which is dedicated to study

2199
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:51,600
to shaping up the Outlook ideology

2200
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,940
personality

2201
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,980
no more no less

2202
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:59,159
usually it takes from 15 to 20 years

2203
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:02,540
what it includes it includes

2204
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:06,000
influencing or by various methods

2205
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,300
infiltration uh propaganda methods

2206
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,699
direct contacts doesn't really matter I

2207
01:43:11,699 --> 01:43:13,560
will describe them later

2208
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,340
of various areas where public opinion is

2209
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:19,560
formulated or shaped

2210
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,300
religion

2211
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,880
educational system

2212
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,739
social life

2213
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:27,480
Administration

2214
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:31,440
law enforcement system military of

2215
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,900
course

2216
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:38,100
and labor and employer relations

2217
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,080
economy okay

2218
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,420
five areas

2219
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:44,280
I will not write them down because we'll

2220
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,179
not have enough space

2221
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,100
some sometimes when I describe all the

2222
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,460
methods uh students ask me question

2223
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,760
are you sure this is the result of the

2224
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,639
Soviet influence not necessarily

2225
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:02,280
you see the tactic of subversion about

2226
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,920
which I'm talking is similar to the

2227
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:08,040
martial art the Japanese martial art

2228
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,900
if you're if some of you are familiar

2229
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,460
with that tactic probably you will

2230
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:13,619
remember that if an enemy is bigger and

2231
01:44:13,619 --> 01:44:16,560
heavier than yourself it would be very

2232
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,179
painful to resist his direct strike

2233
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:23,219
if a heavier person wants to strike me

2234
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:26,520
in the face it would be very naive and

2235
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:30,360
counterproductive to stop his blow

2236
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,940
the Chinese and Japanese

2237
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:36,719
Judo art tells us what to do first to

2238
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,920
avoid the strike then to grab the Fist

2239
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,080
and continue his movement

2240
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:46,320
in the direction where it was before

2241
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,199
right until the enemy crashes in the

2242
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,040
wall

2243
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:53,520
you see so what happens here

2244
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,920
the target country

2245
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,380
obviously does something wrong

2246
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:01,500
if it's a free Democratic Society there

2247
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,420
are many different movements within the

2248
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,840
society

2249
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,119
they're obviously in every society

2250
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,100
there are people who are against this

2251
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,199
Society there may be simple criminals

2252
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,360
ideologically in disagreement with the

2253
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,060
with the state policy conscientious

2254
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:20,639
enemies simply psychotic personalities

2255
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,860
who are against anything

2256
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:25,320
right and finally there are small group

2257
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:28,199
of Agents of a foreign Nation

2258
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:29,400
bought

2259
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,020
subverted

2260
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:33,719
recruited right

2261
01:45:33,719 --> 01:45:36,659
the moment all these movements

2262
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:40,500
will be directed in One Direction right

2263
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,600
this is the time to catch that movement

2264
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,639
and to continue it

2265
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,380
until the movement

2266
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:49,440
forces the whole society into collapse

2267
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:52,500
into crisis right so that's exactly the

2268
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:56,040
martial art tactic we don't stop an

2269
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:59,460
enemy we let him go we help him to go in

2270
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:03,900
the direction we want them to go okay

2271
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:05,880
so on the stage of demoralization

2272
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,219
obviously there are tendencies in each

2273
01:46:08,219 --> 01:46:11,100
Society in each country

2274
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:13,199
which are going

2275
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:15,480
to opposite direction from the basic

2276
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,880
moral values and principles to take

2277
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,520
advantage of these movements to

2278
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,280
capitalize on them is the main purpose

2279
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,800
of the originator of subversion

2280
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:29,580
so we have religion we have education

2281
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:32,340
we have a social life

2282
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,500
we have power structure

2283
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,100
we have Labor Relations

2284
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:40,739
unions and finally we have Law and Order

2285
01:46:40,739 --> 01:46:44,280
one two three four five six okay these

2286
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,320
are the areas of application of

2287
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,500
subversion what it means exactly

2288
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:52,340
in case of religion destroyed

2289
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:54,420
ridicule it

2290
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:58,320
replace it with various sex cults which

2291
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,139
bring people's attention Faith whether

2292
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:02,760
it is naive primitive doesn't really

2293
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,900
matter as long as the basically accepted

2294
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,580
religious Dogma

2295
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:11,580
is being slowly eroded

2296
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:14,820
and taken away from the Supreme purpose

2297
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:18,300
of religion to keep people in touch with

2298
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,520
with the Supreme Being that serves the

2299
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:23,280
purpose therefore replace it accepted

2300
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,260
respected

2301
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:28,320
religious organizations with fake

2302
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,600
organizations

2303
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,179
distract people attention from the real

2304
01:47:33,179 --> 01:47:36,300
faith and attract them to various

2305
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,860
different faces

2306
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:39,600
education

2307
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,760
distract them from learning something

2308
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,880
which is constructive pragmatic

2309
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,500
efficient

2310
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,960
instead of mathematics physics foreign

2311
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,080
languages chemistry teach them history

2312
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,360
of urban Warfare

2313
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,380
natural food

2314
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:02,460
home economy your sexuality

2315
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:06,060
anything long as it takes you away

2316
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:09,480
okay uh social life

2317
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,440
replace traditionally established

2318
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:15,360
institutions and organizations with fake

2319
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,619
organizations

2320
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:18,619
take away the initiative from people

2321
01:48:18,619 --> 01:48:21,420
take away the responsibility from

2322
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,920
naturally established links between

2323
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,780
individuals group of individuals and

2324
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:26,940
Society at large and replace them with

2325
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:29,159
artificial bureaucratically controlled

2326
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:30,780
bodies

2327
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:33,960
instead of social life and friendship

2328
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,480
between Neighbors

2329
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:38,719
establish social workers

2330
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:41,159
institutions they're people who are on

2331
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:42,780
payroll of whom

2332
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,780
Society no bureaucracy

2333
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:48,060
the main concern of social workers is

2334
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:50,040
not your family not you not social

2335
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,080
relations different groups of people the

2336
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,020
main concern is to get the paycheck

2337
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:56,880
from the government

2338
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,860
what will be the result of their social

2339
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:00,600
work doesn't really matter

2340
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:04,619
they can develop all kind of Concepts

2341
01:49:04,619 --> 01:49:07,440
to show them to show to the government

2342
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,139
and to the people that they're useful

2343
01:49:09,139 --> 01:49:13,380
okay away from the natural links power

2344
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:17,580
structure okay the natural bodies of

2345
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,440
administration

2346
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,440
which are traditionally either elected

2347
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,880
by

2348
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:26,760
by people at large or appointed by

2349
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:29,280
elected leaders of society are being

2350
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,440
actively substituted by artificial

2351
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,600
bodies

2352
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,520
the bodies of people groups of people

2353
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,159
whom nobody elected

2354
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:40,500
Never As a matter of fact most of the

2355
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,520
people

2356
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,860
don't like them at all and yet they

2357
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,119
exist

2358
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:48,119
one of such group is Media who elected

2359
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:49,760
them

2360
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,280
how come how come they they face they

2361
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,679
they have so much power almost

2362
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:58,679
monopolistic power on your mind they can

2363
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:01,500
rape your mind but who elected them how

2364
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,080
come they are they have a nerve to

2365
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,000
decide what is good and what is bad for

2366
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,600
for the elected by you president and his

2367
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,540
administration who the hell are they

2368
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:13,860
uh

2369
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:17,219
Spiro Agnew who was hated by the liberal

2370
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:20,219
left called them a bunch of in feebled

2371
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:24,739
snobs and that's exactly what they are

2372
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:28,619
they think they know they don't say the

2373
01:50:28,619 --> 01:50:31,139
level of mediocracy

2374
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:33,239
in a big establishment like New York

2375
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:35,460
Times Los Angeles Times major television

2376
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,860
network you don't have to be excellent

2377
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:39,480
journalists

2378
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,880
you have to be exactly a mediocre

2379
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,679
journalist that's easier to survive

2380
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,840
there's no competition anymore you have

2381
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,900
your good nice income one hundred

2382
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,760
thousand dollars a year that's it

2383
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,619
whether you are better or worse doesn't

2384
01:50:52,619 --> 01:50:54,300
really matter anymore as soon as you're

2385
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,500
smiling to the camera and do your job

2386
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:01,940
that's it no more no more competition

2387
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:04,219
power structure

2388
01:51:04,219 --> 01:51:07,739
slowly is eroded by the bodies and

2389
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:10,440
groups of people who do not have neither

2390
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,020
qualification nor the will of people

2391
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:15,420
to keep them in power and yet they do

2392
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:16,800
have power

2393
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,560
okay together with that there is another

2394
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,179
process

2395
01:51:21,179 --> 01:51:23,119
law enforcement law and order

2396
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:25,199
organization and structure is being

2397
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:26,580
eroded

2398
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:30,179
for the last 20 25 years you you if you

2399
01:51:30,179 --> 01:51:32,219
see old movies and new movies you can

2400
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:36,179
see that in new movies a policeman an

2401
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:38,280
officer of the United States Army looks

2402
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:42,659
dumb angry and psychotic paranoid

2403
01:51:42,659 --> 01:51:46,199
a criminal looks nice kind of well he

2404
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:49,199
smokes hash and and shoots the whatever

2405
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:52,260
drug but basically he's a nice human

2406
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:55,139
being he's creative

2407
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:57,060
and he's unproductive only because

2408
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:00,000
Society oppresses him whereby a general

2409
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,940
pentagon is always by definition a dumb

2410
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,679
a war maniac

2411
01:52:04,679 --> 01:52:08,760
a policeman is a pig Road policeman he

2412
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,920
abuses his power

2413
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,179
no a generality generalization like that

2414
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:19,139
the hatred the mistrust to the people

2415
01:52:19,139 --> 01:52:22,139
who supposed to protect you and enforce

2416
01:52:22,139 --> 01:52:25,139
Law and Order moral relativity the

2417
01:52:25,139 --> 01:52:27,119
Angela Warner process lasted two years

2418
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,679
in Los Angeles

2419
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:30,540
and yet there are still some lawyers who

2420
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:31,560
say look

2421
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:33,540
he's a nice character as a matter of

2422
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:35,340
fact there was some witness who said

2423
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,400
also a criminal who said well he's a

2424
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,860
nice guy I asked him one day to burn a

2425
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:44,780
house of my enemy and he wouldn't do it

2426
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:53,820
a slow substitution of basic moral

2427
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:55,159
principles

2428
01:52:55,159 --> 01:52:57,900
whereby a criminal is not a criminal

2429
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:00,300
actually he's a defendant

2430
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:03,300
even if his skill is proven

2431
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,820
there is still a doubt

2432
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:08,520
to kill or not to kill to be or not to

2433
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,679
be thy shall not kill yes

2434
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:14,820
but this line may not necessarily be

2435
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,739
applicable to a murderer

2436
01:53:16,739 --> 01:53:19,440
thy shall not murder that should be the

2437
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,540
the presumption not not that thy shall

2438
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:25,139
not kill okay Labor Relations

2439
01:53:25,139 --> 01:53:29,219
at this stage within 15 to 20 years

2440
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:32,760
we destroy the

2441
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,860
traditionally established Links of

2442
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:38,820
bargaining between employer and employee

2443
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:41,420
the classical Marxist leninist

2444
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:44,880
theory of natural exchange of goods

2445
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,920
uh

2446
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:49,920
a person a has five sacks of grain and

2447
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,400
person B has five pairs of shoes

2448
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:55,739
and the natural exchange without money

2449
01:53:55,739 --> 01:53:59,760
is when they bargain between each other

2450
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,860
and only with the introduction of the

2451
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:04,040
third four C

2452
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:08,219
an entirely third foreign stranger who

2453
01:54:08,219 --> 01:54:10,139
says no don't give him five sacks of

2454
01:54:10,139 --> 01:54:12,900
brain give it to me and you give me your

2455
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,460
five pairs of shoes and I will

2456
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:16,800
distribute it accordingly

2457
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,860
so the economy will go

2458
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:23,520
this is the death of natural exchange

2459
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,739
that death of natural bargaining well

2460
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:28,139
trade unions were established 100 years

2461
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:31,139
ago the objective was to improve working

2462
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:33,600
conditions and to protect the rights of

2463
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:37,260
workers from those employers who were

2464
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:38,760
abusing

2465
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:41,040
they're they're right because they had

2466
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,380
more money

2467
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,719
objectively at that time initially the

2468
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:47,820
Trade union movement did work what we

2469
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:48,960
see now

2470
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,719
is that the bargaining process is no

2471
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:56,280
longer resulting into in the compromise

2472
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,820
which is leading objectively to

2473
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:01,320
betterment of working conditions and

2474
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:03,960
increase of salary what we see

2475
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:07,560
is that after each prolonged strike the

2476
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,360
workers lose

2477
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,880
even if they have 10 increase of their

2478
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:14,159
salaries they cannot catch up due to

2479
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,500
inflation and due to missed time

2480
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,560
more than that millions of people suffer

2481
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,420
from that strike

2482
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:24,360
because economy now is interdependent

2483
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,780
it's intertwined like one body

2484
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:30,780
if previously Steel Workers say hundred

2485
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,699
years ago could strike and nobody would

2486
01:55:32,699 --> 01:55:36,480
suffer now it's impossible anymore if a

2487
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:39,300
garbage collector strikes today the rest

2488
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:42,420
of the multi-million city is stinking I

2489
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:46,260
mean there's no more service in Quebec

2490
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:48,179
for example we had the electricians who

2491
01:55:48,179 --> 01:55:51,540
were on strike in the middle of winter

2492
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:54,179
you can freeze your bottom and they

2493
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:55,980
still weren't strike

2494
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,900
did they catch up with the celery no

2495
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,719
they lost who benefited the leaders of

2496
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:01,800
Trade union

2497
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,260
what is the motivation for stride

2498
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:07,020
improving improving our workers

2499
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:10,260
condition no no obviously it's not

2500
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,119
then what is it

2501
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:14,340
ID oh Lord G

2502
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:17,520
to prove to these capitalists

2503
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,159
and the obedient horde of workers like

2504
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:22,080
sheep follow these people and they

2505
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,900
cannot disobey why because if they do

2506
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:27,780
you know what happens to them tickets

2507
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:31,260
murders shooting truck drivers by

2508
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:34,199
ticketers in Montreal for example I saw

2509
01:56:34,199 --> 01:56:35,639
with my own eyes when I was

2510
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:37,400
correspondent of CBC International

2511
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:40,199
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation when

2512
01:56:40,199 --> 01:56:41,900
the workers of aircraft Factory

2513
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:44,699
destroyed computers and and the

2514
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:46,980
equipment in the factory

2515
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:49,679
and they the administration employed

2516
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,260
strike Breakers their cars were turned

2517
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,139
upside down and burned

2518
01:56:55,139 --> 01:56:57,659
their houses were burned their kids were

2519
01:56:57,659 --> 01:57:00,179
intimidated and some victims were there

2520
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:03,420
of that you can be sure why

2521
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:06,420
to improve conditions of workers no

2522
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:09,900
ideology okay so this is what happens

2523
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,880
basically

2524
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,340
it may or may not happen without the

2525
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:15,960
help of the Soviet Union

2526
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:18,719
but the natural tendencies

2527
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:21,420
are being greatly taken advantage of and

2528
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,460
capitalized by the Soviet propaganda

2529
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,920
systems how

2530
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,320
whenever Trade union strikes we have

2531
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,020
influx of propaganda mass media

2532
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:34,020
ideological dissemination the workers

2533
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:36,540
right and repeated like parrots yes

2534
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:39,300
workers right who's rights workers no

2535
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:42,540
the the only freedom of worker to sell

2536
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:45,179
his labor according to his own desire

2537
01:57:45,179 --> 01:57:47,520
and will is taken away from him by whom

2538
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,760
by Trade union boss

2539
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,320
unlimited power is given responsibility

2540
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,139
I want to sell my labor not for 250 an

2541
01:57:55,139 --> 01:57:56,940
hour but for two dollars I don't have

2542
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,139
right

2543
01:57:58,139 --> 01:58:00,420
my freedom is denied to me

2544
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:03,060
I know that if I sell my work for 200

2545
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:04,860
for two dollars an hour not for three

2546
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:07,380
dollars now I will compete better with

2547
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:09,599
the other guy who is lazy and more

2548
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,060
greedy I don't need to three dollars I

2549
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:14,880
need only two dollars no I was made to

2550
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,520
believe by media my business by

2551
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,619
advertising agencies that I need more

2552
01:58:19,619 --> 01:58:21,659
and more and more have you ever heard

2553
01:58:21,659 --> 01:58:24,860
any advertising on TV to consume less

2554
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:28,340
no no way

2555
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:31,560
whether you need a six-cylinder car or

2556
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,599
not you have to buy it and hurry up

2557
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,000
when I was driving here on the local

2558
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,540
radio station an excited announcer said

2559
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:45,719
you hurry up rush and save save save

2560
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:49,580
there's a plenty of houses sale

2561
01:58:50,119 --> 01:58:51,679
save

2562
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:55,340
by buying more

2563
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:59,880
of course of course it would be too

2564
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:02,099
naive to expect that KGB makes that

2565
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:04,739
advertising agency to do such a crazy

2566
01:59:04,739 --> 01:59:07,260
commercial no of course not

2567
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:09,780
but what we did when I was working for

2568
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:13,020
novelty pressing we would snow plow

2569
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:16,080
editorial offices student organizations

2570
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,360
religious groups with literature of

2571
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,400
class struggle

2572
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,340
May if if not directly Marxism

2573
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:25,020
propaganda then

2574
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:27,540
a propaganda of of a legitimate

2575
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:30,360
aspirations of working class betterment

2576
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:35,040
of Life equality equality mind you

2577
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,440
President Kennedy once said people we

2578
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,239
will make America to believe that people

2579
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:40,980
are born equal

2580
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:43,440
are people born equal

2581
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:46,320
is there any mentioning in the Bible or

2582
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,280
any other Holy scripture in any religion

2583
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,719
any religion if you don't believe me go

2584
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:54,360
to library and check it that is not a

2585
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:57,179
single word about equality

2586
01:59:57,179 --> 01:59:59,760
just the opposite

2587
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,300
by your Deeds God will judge you what

2588
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:07,080
you do is important the Merit of your

2589
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,340
personality

2590
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:11,219
you cannot legislate equality if you

2591
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:13,500
want to be equal you have to be equal

2592
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:16,619
you have to deserve it

2593
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:19,920
and yet we build our society on the

2594
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,840
principle of equality we say people are

2595
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:26,219
equal we know it is false it's a lie

2596
02:00:26,219 --> 02:00:29,460
some people are tall and stupid others

2597
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:33,020
are short bold and clever

2598
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:45,920
if we make them

2599
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:53,540
if we make them equal by force

2600
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:57,599
if we put the principle of equality in

2601
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:59,639
the basis of our social political

2602
02:00:59,639 --> 02:01:00,900
structure

2603
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:03,900
is the same thing as building a house on

2604
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:05,219
sand

2605
02:01:05,219 --> 02:01:08,040
ER or later it will collapse and that's

2606
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,080
exactly what happens

2607
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:13,080
and we as Soviet propaganda makers are

2608
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,119
trying to push you in the direction

2609
02:01:15,119 --> 02:01:17,880
which you go yourself equality yes

2610
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:20,940
equality people are equal land of equal

2611
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:23,460
opportunities

2612
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:27,360
is it true or not think about it

2613
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,520
equal opportunities should there be

2614
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:32,099
equal opportunities for me

2615
02:01:32,099 --> 02:01:34,139
and for a lazy bastard who come here

2616
02:01:34,139 --> 02:01:36,420
from some other country and immediately

2617
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:39,119
registers as a welfare recipient

2618
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:40,739
benefits

2619
02:01:40,739 --> 02:01:43,020
I never received a single dot note sorry

2620
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:46,199
I did visit once but I never applied for

2621
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:49,980
welfare for the 13 years I took any job

2622
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:53,340
security guard journalist Taxi Driver

2623
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:54,780
anything

2624
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,580
while I was restless but some people

2625
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:59,580
don't like it they immediately so why

2626
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:01,139
should we be why should we have equal

2627
02:02:01,139 --> 02:02:02,880
opportunities

2628
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,380
why the equal opportunity to excel

2629
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:10,380
equal opportunity in equal circumstances

2630
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:12,540
yes but we know people are different so

2631
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:15,599
Excel yes provided we reach the same

2632
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:19,080
level of Excellency perfection

2633
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:22,139
which is hypothetical distant future yes

2634
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:23,219
maybe

2635
02:02:23,219 --> 02:02:25,679
but we know perfectly well that even

2636
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:28,679
with the best intentions people could

2637
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:31,560
not be equal

2638
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:34,860
why should we have equality in in the

2639
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:38,099
say legal system myself

2640
02:02:38,099 --> 02:02:40,440
I'm considering myself a law abiding

2641
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:41,760
citizen

2642
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,760
and a person who comes here to Rob and

2643
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,760
shoot say the United States

2644
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:49,380
Administration on the card have imported

2645
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:52,860
thousands of Cuban criminals

2646
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:55,020
they were non-criminals

2647
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:56,940
yet they were accepted

2648
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:59,880
do you think it's fair if myself and my

2649
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:02,460
wife from Philippines who work like a

2650
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:05,400
excuse me horse as a lab technician in

2651
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:08,520
the hospital should have the same rights

2652
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:12,179
as a criminal film from Cuba

2653
02:03:12,179 --> 02:03:13,739
why

2654
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:16,260
and yet we repeat as parents equality

2655
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:18,179
equality equality

2656
02:03:18,179 --> 02:03:20,400
and the Soviet propaganda system helps

2657
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,080
us to believe that equality is something

2658
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:24,840
which is desirable democracy as it was

2659
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,699
established by fathers of this country

2660
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:30,840
of the system in the last century is is

2661
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:33,420
not equality

2662
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:35,840
is the system where different people

2663
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,580
unequal people have a chance to survive

2664
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:40,139
and help each other

2665
02:03:40,139 --> 02:03:42,540
in constant competition

2666
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:45,540
in constant perfection

2667
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:48,179
not inequality which is superimposed

2668
02:03:48,179 --> 02:03:52,320
from from a Godfather or nice person in

2669
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:54,119
Washington DC

2670
02:03:54,119 --> 02:03:57,480
and the absolute equality exists in

2671
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:00,119
Soviet Union quote unquote equality

2672
02:04:00,119 --> 02:04:04,199
everybody is equally in dirt

2673
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:06,360
except some people are more equal than

2674
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:10,739
the others in politburo so

2675
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:15,719
the moment you you bring a country to

2676
02:04:15,719 --> 02:04:17,460
the point of almost thought of

2677
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:19,679
demoralization when nothing works

2678
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:22,260
anymore when you are not sure whether it

2679
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:26,280
is right or or wrong good and bad but

2680
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,260
there's no division between evil and

2681
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:31,139
good when even the leaders of church

2682
02:04:31,139 --> 02:04:34,080
sometimes say well violence for the sake

2683
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:36,719
of Justice especially social justice is

2684
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,659
Justified in the countries like

2685
02:04:38,659 --> 02:04:41,820
Nicaragua El Salvador well maybe

2686
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:43,199
Rhodesia

2687
02:04:43,199 --> 02:04:45,420
and we listen to them and say yeah

2688
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:49,260
probably it's true is it true no it is

2689
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:51,440
not true violence is not justified

2690
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:54,119
especially for the sake of quote unquote

2691
02:04:54,119 --> 02:04:56,699
social justice introduced by Marxist

2692
02:04:56,699 --> 02:04:59,400
leninist that is my former College

2693
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,619
from novice to press agency okay so

2694
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,840
where is that point the next step is

2695
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:06,739
destabilization

2696
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:14,040
again this word says for itself what it

2697
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:16,800
is to destabilize all the relations all

2698
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:19,980
the accepted institutions and

2699
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:22,199
organizations in a country of your enemy

2700
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:23,820
how you do it

2701
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:26,639
you don't have to send a battalion of

2702
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:29,940
KGB agents to blow up Bridges no you let

2703
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:32,460
them do it themselves

2704
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:35,400
the area of application is again it's

2705
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,260
it's narrower now

2706
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:40,440
not like the previous case the overt

2707
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:44,280
legitimate actions of the of the KGB in

2708
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:45,360
this case

2709
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:48,480
would be hardly noticeable there is no

2710
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,520
crime if a professor who recently went

2711
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,739
to USSR introduces a course of marxist

2712
02:05:52,739 --> 02:05:56,099
leninism in in a Californian college for

2713
02:05:56,099 --> 02:05:57,960
example nobody is going to to come to

2714
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:00,739
his doorstep and say okay Mister come

2715
02:06:00,739 --> 02:06:03,420
you're on the rest no it's not a crime

2716
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:05,460
it's not even considered a moral crime

2717
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,320
against your country

2718
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:09,840
so the area of application here is

2719
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,380
narrowing down to economy

2720
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:16,020
again Labor Relations right

2721
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:19,159
so Law and Order

2722
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:24,619
plus military

2723
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,420
and uh

2724
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:30,840
economy Law and Order yes and again the

2725
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:34,320
uh media but why the scope little bit

2726
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:37,440
different I'll explain again

2727
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:41,219
okay basically three areas economy

2728
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:42,560
the

2729
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:46,080
radicalization of bargaining process

2730
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:49,080
if on that stage

2731
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,239
we still could achieve theoretically

2732
02:06:51,239 --> 02:06:54,000
some positive compromise between the

2733
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,800
negotiating sides with with uh say

2734
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,400
the arbitrary introduction of arbitrary

2735
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:05,760
judges a third side objectively judging

2736
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,300
the demands of both sides here it's

2737
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:11,280
radicalization

2738
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,380
on this on the stage of destabilization

2739
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:16,860
we cannot come to compromise even within

2740
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,840
a family the husband and wife couldn't

2741
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,900
figure out which is better husband wants

2742
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:24,000
his kids to eat at the table and wife

2743
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
wants him a child to roam around the

2744
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,280
room and and drop food all over the

2745
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,679
floor they cannot come to compromise

2746
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:34,080
unless they start a fight

2747
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,239
it's impossible to reach a compromise

2748
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:37,800
constructive compromise between

2749
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:40,739
Neighbors some people say I don't like

2750
02:07:40,739 --> 02:07:42,659
you to watering you alone at that time

2751
02:07:42,659 --> 02:07:44,460
because exactly at that time I'm walking

2752
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:47,520
my dog and he's getting nervous he

2753
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,000
cannot pass his bowels you know so they

2754
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,880
cannot compromise they go to

2755
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:57,619
a a civil court or something like that

2756
02:07:57,619 --> 02:08:01,380
radicalization of human relations no

2757
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,900
more compromise fight fight fight

2758
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,179
the normal traditionally accepted

2759
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:08,639
relations are destabilized

2760
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,679
the relations between teachers and

2761
02:08:10,679 --> 02:08:12,119
students

2762
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:15,900
in schools and colleges fight

2763
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:18,420
the relations between an economical

2764
02:08:18,420 --> 02:08:19,639
sphere between

2765
02:08:19,639 --> 02:08:22,860
laborers and and employers are further

2766
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:25,380
radicalized

2767
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:29,699
no more acceptance of the legitimacy of

2768
02:08:29,699 --> 02:08:31,320
Demands of workers

2769
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:33,900
unlike Japanese where the theories if

2770
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:36,420
you ever heard about it whether workers

2771
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:38,340
are involved in decision-making process

2772
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,860
therefore they don't have moral

2773
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:43,920
incentive to to fight their uh their

2774
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:45,780
bosses in the United States is just the

2775
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:48,480
opposite the harder is the the fight the

2776
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:51,179
better the more heroic they look when

2777
02:08:51,179 --> 02:08:54,599
the Greyhound network was on strike

2778
02:08:54,599 --> 02:08:58,500
recently the correspondence of local TV

2779
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:01,920
networks all over the United States

2780
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,800
were approaching these Strikers and they

2781
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,599
say oh yes we are doing something nice

2782
02:09:06,599 --> 02:09:08,400
they look like Heroes and they were

2783
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:11,280
proud there was some family uh the

2784
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:14,880
husband was a bus driver now they

2785
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:17,820
decided in in in a protest against the

2786
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:20,699
uh bosses to Camp somewhere in the

2787
02:09:20,699 --> 02:09:22,020
forest

2788
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:24,239
and they were presented to the to the

2789
02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:28,020
audience as as a heroic nice people

2790
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:29,400
you see

2791
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,739
the violent clashes between passengers

2792
02:09:31,739 --> 02:09:34,320
ticketers and and the strikers are

2793
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:37,580
presented as something normal

2794
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:42,300
10 15 20 years ago we would we would be

2795
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:44,760
we would be angry say why why why so

2796
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:46,560
much hatred

2797
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:49,500
today we are not we say well

2798
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,619
commonplace radicalization

2799
02:09:51,619 --> 02:09:54,780
militarization sometimes as I explained

2800
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:58,080
on that stage I took a step a little bit

2801
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:02,159
further shooting people okay Law and

2802
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:03,420
Order now

2803
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:06,119
also is

2804
02:10:06,119 --> 02:10:10,020
uh pushed into the area where previously

2805
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:13,440
people settle their differences uh

2806
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:15,540
peacefully and legitimately

2807
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:17,040
now

2808
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,300
we are getting with this court cases in

2809
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:25,260
the in this smallest irrelevant cases we

2810
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:27,780
cannot solve our problems anymore

2811
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:30,659
the society at large becomes more and

2812
02:10:30,659 --> 02:10:32,639
more antagonistic

2813
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:34,860
within individuals between groups of

2814
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:37,800
individuals and the society at Large

2815
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:41,099
the media puts himself in the opposition

2816
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:45,300
to the society in general at Large

2817
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:48,060
separate alienated

2818
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:49,260
okay

2819
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:51,840
on that stage you remember I was talking

2820
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:55,199
uh a couple of hours ago about the

2821
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:56,760
sleepers

2822
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:59,699
that's when the students from say United

2823
02:10:59,699 --> 02:11:02,159
States if they are trained in lumumba

2824
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:04,500
University or developing nations that's

2825
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,239
the students I was dealing with are

2826
02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:08,760
being sent back

2827
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:11,940
from the Soviet Union here or if they

2828
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:13,920
were already in the United States in the

2829
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:16,139
country which is the object of

2830
02:11:16,139 --> 02:11:19,260
subversion they spring to action the

2831
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:21,960
sleepers go up

2832
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:25,739
they slept for 15 to 20 years

2833
02:11:25,739 --> 02:11:28,980
now they become leaders of groups

2834
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:30,780
preachers

2835
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:32,340
uh

2836
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:34,860
I don't know Public public figures

2837
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:37,560
prominently they act in they actively

2838
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:39,599
include themselves in a political

2839
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:42,000
process all of a sudden we see a

2840
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,800
homosexual

2841
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:47,460
15 years ago he did his dirty job and

2842
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:50,219
nobody cared now he makes it a political

2843
02:11:50,219 --> 02:11:53,460
issue he demands recognition respect

2844
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:56,580
human rights and hiral is a large group

2845
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:59,099
of people and there are violent clashes

2846
02:11:59,099 --> 02:12:01,440
between him and police his group and

2847
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:04,320
Ordinary People no matter what it's

2848
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,659
black against white yellows again green

2849
02:12:06,659 --> 02:12:09,119
doesn't matter where's the vision line

2850
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:11,639
goes as long as this group come into

2851
02:12:11,639 --> 02:12:14,540
antagonistic Clash sometimes militantly

2852
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:17,760
sometimes with firearms that is

2853
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:21,360
destabilization process the sleepers

2854
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:24,540
many of whom are simply KGB agents

2855
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:26,880
become leaders

2856
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:29,280
of the process of destabilization

2857
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:31,080
doesn't mean that comrade and drop of

2858
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:33,780
sons comrade Ivanov the United States

2859
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:35,820
the person who takes care is already

2860
02:12:35,820 --> 02:12:37,860
here

2861
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:40,440
his respected citizen of United States

2862
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:43,380
sometimes he he gets money from various

2863
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:46,340
foundations for his legitimate

2864
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:48,540
struggle for

2865
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:51,060
I don't know human rights women rights

2866
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,579
kid lib prison lib whatever

2867
02:12:53,579 --> 02:12:55,560
there are sympathetic Americans who

2868
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:57,960
donate their money to him

2869
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:00,060
this to be like this stabilization

2870
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:03,000
process usually leads directly to the

2871
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,820
process of crisis in case of developing

2872
02:13:05,820 --> 02:13:07,560
nations

2873
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:11,159
does the area where I I was active the

2874
02:13:11,159 --> 02:13:12,540
process

2875
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:15,199
starts

2876
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,460
when

2877
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:24,300
when the legitimate

2878
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:26,820
bodies of power

2879
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:29,400
the social structure collapse it cannot

2880
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,320
function anymore

2881
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:34,199
so instead we have artificial's body

2882
02:13:34,199 --> 02:13:36,800
injected into society such as

2883
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:39,060
non-elected committees

2884
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:40,800
you remember I was talking about them

2885
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,159
here social workers who are not elected

2886
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:46,079
by People Media who sell who are

2887
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:49,440
self-appointed rulers of your opinion uh

2888
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,480
some strange groups

2889
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,780
which claim that they know how to lead

2890
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:57,780
Society forward they don't usually all

2891
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,340
they care is how to collect donations

2892
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:02,119
and and prom and sell their own

2893
02:14:02,119 --> 02:14:04,980
concocted ideology mixture of religion

2894
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:08,520
and ideology here we have all these

2895
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,719
artificial's body claiming power

2896
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:15,000
if the power is denied to them they take

2897
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,159
it by force

2898
02:14:17,159 --> 02:14:19,320
in case of Iran for example all of a

2899
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:21,540
sudden we have revolutionary committees

2900
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:23,820
who what what kind of Revolution there

2901
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,679
was no Revolution yet and yet they had

2902
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:27,300
the Committees

2903
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,940
they were taking power of judgment they

2904
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:32,460
had they had the power of execution they

2905
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:36,239
had the power of of legislation and that

2906
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:39,960
they had the power of judicial all of

2907
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,639
them combined in one person who is

2908
02:14:41,639 --> 02:14:43,320
half-baked intellectual sometimes

2909
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:45,900
radiated from Harvard University or

2910
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:48,239
Berkeley

2911
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:50,880
he comes back to his country and then he

2912
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,920
he thinks that he he knows the answer to

2913
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:55,440
all the social economical problems

2914
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:59,460
okay crisis is when Society cannot

2915
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:01,320
function any more productively it

2916
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,540
collapses obviously that's the word for

2917
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:04,560
crisis

2918
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:08,219
so therefore the population at Large

2919
02:15:08,219 --> 02:15:11,040
is looking for a savior

2920
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:13,380
the religious groups are expecting a

2921
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:15,000
messiah to come

2922
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,300
the work is safe we have family to feed

2923
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:20,639
let's have a strong government maybe

2924
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:22,679
socialist government centralized when

2925
02:15:22,679 --> 02:15:26,099
when somebody put put their employers on

2926
02:15:26,099 --> 02:15:29,099
their place and and let us work we are

2927
02:15:29,099 --> 02:15:30,960
sick and tired of going to strike and

2928
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,719
missing overtime and all that stuff we

2929
02:15:33,719 --> 02:15:37,260
need some strong man strong government a

2930
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:38,520
leader

2931
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:42,420
a savior is needed population is sick

2932
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:44,280
and tired already

2933
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:47,579
and here we are we have a savior either

2934
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:50,699
a foreign Nation comes in or the local

2935
02:15:50,699 --> 02:15:54,540
group of of leftists marxists no matter

2936
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:57,420
what they call themselves Sandinista

2937
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,420
a reverend or some sort

2938
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:03,659
Bishop Missouri like in in Zimbabwe

2939
02:16:03,659 --> 02:16:05,639
doesn't matter

2940
02:16:05,639 --> 02:16:08,940
a savior comes and says I will lead you

2941
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:12,920
so we have two Alternatives here

2942
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,040
Civil War

2943
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:20,060
an invasion

2944
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:23,340
okay

2945
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:25,139
see how it goes

2946
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:27,599
Civil War we know what it is Lebanon is

2947
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:29,280
the best example

2948
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:31,880
the Civil War which was artificially

2949
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,218
implanted in Lebanon by injection of

2950
02:16:35,218 --> 02:16:37,019
force of PLO

2951
02:16:37,019 --> 02:16:39,260
Palestinian Liberation Organization

2952
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:41,638
Invasion we have in many other countries

2953
02:16:41,638 --> 02:16:43,799
like Afghanistan

2954
02:16:43,799 --> 02:16:45,379
uh

2955
02:16:45,379 --> 02:16:48,660
name any East European country it was

2956
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:51,478
invaded by the Soviet Army

2957
02:16:51,478 --> 02:16:53,638
but the result is the same the next

2958
02:16:53,638 --> 02:16:57,620
stage is normalization

2959
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:01,019
normalization is a very ironic word of

2960
02:17:01,019 --> 02:17:03,200
course

2961
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:09,058
it is borrowed from 1968 situation in

2962
02:17:09,058 --> 02:17:10,558
Czechoslovakia when the Soviet

2963
02:17:10,558 --> 02:17:13,260
propaganda and after them New York Times

2964
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:15,898
declared the country is normalized the

2965
02:17:15,898 --> 02:17:17,820
tanks moved into Prague so there is no

2966
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:20,040
more Prague spring there is no more

2967
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:23,939
violence normal normalization

2968
02:17:23,939 --> 02:17:26,700
at that stage

2969
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:28,280
the

2970
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:31,138
self-appointed rulers of the society

2971
02:17:31,138 --> 02:17:33,840
don't need any Revolution anymore they

2972
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,058
don't need any radicalism anymore so

2973
02:17:36,058 --> 02:17:38,959
this is the reverse from destabilization

2974
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:41,879
basically it is stabilizing the country

2975
02:17:41,879 --> 02:17:43,799
by force

2976
02:17:43,799 --> 02:17:47,040
so all these sleepers and activists and

2977
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,679
social workers and liberals

2978
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:52,978
and homosexuals and professors and

2979
02:17:52,978 --> 02:17:55,260
Marxist and latinists are being

2980
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:56,700
eliminated

2981
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:58,679
physically sometimes

2982
02:17:58,679 --> 02:18:01,379
they've done their job already okay they

2983
02:18:01,379 --> 02:18:03,420
are not needed anymore

2984
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:05,120
foreign

2985
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:08,939
ERS need stability to exploit the nation

2986
02:18:08,939 --> 02:18:10,799
to exploit the country to take

2987
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:13,679
advantages of the victory

2988
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:16,679
okay so no more evolutionaries please

2989
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:18,478
and that's exactly what happens in

2990
02:18:18,478 --> 02:18:19,978
number of countries you remember

2991
02:18:19,978 --> 02:18:22,379
Bangladesh this is the crisis in which I

2992
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:24,478
was instrumental first they had mujibur

2993
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:26,340
Rahman

2994
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:29,340
in 1971 he was the leader of people's

2995
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:31,859
party avami league with mustache like

2996
02:18:31,859 --> 02:18:35,638
Stalin he was in in Russia many times

2997
02:18:35,638 --> 02:18:37,920
in five years he was shocked by his

2998
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:41,160
former colleagues marxists

2999
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:43,320
he fulfilled His function in Afghanistan

3000
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,179
it happened three times

3001
02:18:45,179 --> 02:18:46,740
because there was taraki then there was

3002
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:49,138
Amin nowadays they killed each other

3003
02:18:49,138 --> 02:18:50,939
successively

3004
02:18:50,939 --> 02:18:53,398
one after another the moment he fulfills

3005
02:18:53,398 --> 02:18:55,859
his duty the first one demoralized

3006
02:18:55,859 --> 02:18:58,019
country the second destabilized the

3007
02:18:58,019 --> 02:18:59,820
third one brought it to crisis

3008
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:01,920
goodbye comrade

3009
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:04,920
Karma comes from Moscow and put in into

3010
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,898
the seat of power

3011
02:19:06,898 --> 02:19:09,718
same thing happened in Granada recently

3012
02:19:09,718 --> 02:19:12,478
Maurice Bishop Marxist was killed by

3013
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:14,638
Austin what's his name General something

3014
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:17,280
who was also a Marxist

3015
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:18,660
right

3016
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,718
so no more revolutions please

3017
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:24,420
normalization now from now on no more

3018
02:19:24,420 --> 02:19:27,660
strikes no more homosexual sexuals no

3019
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:30,359
more women live no more kidly no more

3020
02:19:30,359 --> 02:19:33,000
lib period

3021
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
good

3022
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,320
Democratic proletarian freedom

3023
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:45,478
now to reverse this process

3024
02:19:45,478 --> 02:19:47,879
takes enormous effort

3025
02:19:47,879 --> 02:19:52,140
when today United States had to invade

3026
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:55,320
Granada to reverse the process of

3027
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:57,720
subversion some people say boy this is

3028
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:00,180
not good it's not kosher to invade a

3029
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:03,479
beautiful country the island of Granada

3030
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:05,580
well why didn't you stop the process

3031
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:08,280
here when Granada was just approached by

3032
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:09,479
leftists

3033
02:20:09,479 --> 02:20:11,580
why not to prevent Maurice Bishop to

3034
02:20:11,580 --> 02:20:13,320
come in power in the first place did

3035
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:16,320
grenades want him very questionable they

3036
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:17,580
didn't know who was more respiration

3037
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:19,560
from the first place he came to Power by

3038
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,840
coup d'etat himself

3039
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:25,080
okay nor will let the situation develop

3040
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,640
further and further and further until

3041
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,439
the crisis

3042
02:20:28,439 --> 02:20:31,740
and normalization very soon

3043
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:34,200
and then United States decided to invade

3044
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:36,479
country discovering that the country was

3045
02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:38,399
absolutely a military base for the

3046
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:40,319
Soviet Union

3047
02:20:40,319 --> 02:20:42,300
of course it's a drastic measure of

3048
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:44,280
course it's it's a Pity that Marine

3049
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:47,220
Corps had to to lose what 17 lives very

3050
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:48,180
bad

3051
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:50,280
why not to stop the process before it

3052
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:52,920
comes to crisis all no intellectuals

3053
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:55,140
will not let you its interference into

3054
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:58,380
domestic affairs they're very careful

3055
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:00,420
not to not not to let American

3056
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:02,819
Administration to interfere in domestic

3057
02:21:02,819 --> 02:21:05,100
affairs of Latin American countries they

3058
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:06,780
don't mind Soviet Union interfere in

3059
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:08,540
this Affairs

3060
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:12,660
so to reverse this process from here it

3061
02:21:12,660 --> 02:21:17,100
takes only and always military force no

3062
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:19,319
other force on Earth can reverse this

3063
02:21:19,319 --> 02:21:21,660
process at this point

3064
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:24,720
at this point it does not take military

3065
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:27,960
invasion of United States Army it takes

3066
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:31,439
strong action like in Chile

3067
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:35,160
a CIA called word involvement

3068
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:37,859
to prevent the Savior from outside to

3069
02:21:37,859 --> 02:21:39,420
come into power

3070
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:41,700
and to stabilize country before it

3071
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:44,340
erupts into Civil War

3072
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:46,500
okay support

3073
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:48,899
the right-wing conservative forces by

3074
02:21:48,899 --> 02:21:51,479
money by Crooks so love doesn't matter

3075
02:21:51,479 --> 02:21:53,399
stabilize the can don't let the crisis

3076
02:21:53,399 --> 02:21:56,340
develop into into Civil War or invasion

3077
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:58,560
oh no your liberals will say it's it's

3078
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,540
against the law

3079
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:03,240
the Congress will not appropriate money

3080
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:07,920
for covert actions of CIA why not

3081
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:10,020
should we wait till the normalization

3082
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:12,120
come and Soviet tanks landed in in Los

3083
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:14,520
Angeles Airport

3084
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:17,220
now at that point at the point of this

3085
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:19,319
stabilization also the process could be

3086
02:22:19,319 --> 02:22:22,319
reversed again easily than this no CIA

3087
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:24,479
involvement at this point

3088
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:27,120
you know what it takes here

3089
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:30,540
restriction of some Liberties for small

3090
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:33,359
groups which are self-declared enemies

3091
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:36,359
of the society as simple as that

3092
02:22:36,359 --> 02:22:38,580
oh no the median liberals will tell you

3093
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:39,600
this is against the American

3094
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,640
Constitution

3095
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:44,540
how can we

3096
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:48,420
by force deny the civil rights to

3097
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:52,140
criminals for example it's not good

3098
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:55,319
okay so we allow them to okay if you

3099
02:22:55,319 --> 02:22:57,240
allow the criminals to have civil rights

3100
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:59,160
go on and bring the country to the

3101
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,979
crisis this is a bloodless way to do

3102
02:23:01,979 --> 02:23:04,620
curb the rights I mean not to put them

3103
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:06,060
in prison no no I'm not talking about

3104
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,620
putting all the gates from San Francisco

3105
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:11,040
in the concentration camp do not allow

3106
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:15,060
them to take political force

3107
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:18,020
do not elect them to the seats of power

3108
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:21,180
whether it is municipality level state

3109
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:23,280
level or federal level

3110
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,399
it has to be bitten in the heads of

3111
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:29,340
American voters at a person like that in

3112
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:32,100
the sense of power is an enemy

3113
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:34,680
do not be afraid of this word it is an

3114
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:37,500
enemy if he is not an enemy here he will

3115
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,060
be here

3116
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:42,380
later on he will be shot of course

3117
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:47,760
but at this point he is an enemy okay

3118
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:50,160
you are doing great service by denying

3119
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:51,780
him a right

3120
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:56,220
to capitalize on his own crazy ideas and

3121
02:23:56,220 --> 02:24:00,840
become a powerful man a man who uses the

3122
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:03,020
seat of power

3123
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:05,460
restriction of certain freedoms and

3124
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:07,680
permissiveness at that point

3125
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,500
would prevent

3126
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,780
sliding into crisis and probably will

3127
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:15,540
return the process of destabilization to

3128
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,120
curb unlimited power monopolistic power

3129
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:21,240
of trade unions here at that point would

3130
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:23,880
save economy from collapsing

3131
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:26,220
to introduce a law

3132
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:30,240
to stop private companies of raping

3133
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,580
public opinions mind

3134
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:36,240
in the direction of consumerism

3135
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:39,780
no company must have a right

3136
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:42,780
to force you into buying more unless you

3137
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:45,260
want it

3138
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:47,640
there must be a law

3139
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:50,180
you want to advertise your your car okay

3140
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:53,880
but not a single mentioning of buying it

3141
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:57,319
now and saving money

3142
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,260
must be against the law to force people

3143
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:04,399
to consume more

3144
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:06,479
self-restrained

3145
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:09,120
previously before this process started

3146
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,160
the self-restraint

3147
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:14,700
was a business of church religion

3148
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:17,100
because our preachers the fathers of

3149
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:18,720
church would tell us

3150
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:22,080
material values are good but it's not

3151
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,240
the prime function of human being

3152
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:26,960
because you have to live with something

3153
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:30,000
obviously the design for our life is not

3154
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,899
to consume more deodorants

3155
02:25:32,899 --> 02:25:36,359
there must be something greater if such

3156
02:25:36,359 --> 02:25:39,120
a complicated instrument this human body

3157
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:42,180
was created obviously there must be some

3158
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:44,939
higher purpose for that

3159
02:25:44,939 --> 02:25:47,700
and it's very easy to

3160
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:49,920
by deny

3161
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,100
deny greedy companies one little Freedom

3162
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:56,100
one little liberty forcing you into

3163
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:59,040
turning yourself into processors of

3164
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:02,460
unwanted products and goods

3165
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:05,580
they turn you into machines

3166
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:09,660
like uh the worm who there's Inlet and

3167
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:12,540
outlets and

3168
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:15,420
how long an average appliance lasts

3169
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:16,500
these days

3170
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:20,520
less than a year why

3171
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:23,460
where's workmanship or we want you to

3172
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:26,700
buy more okay this stabilization process

3173
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:30,120
could be easily overcome if as I say

3174
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,859
the society

3175
02:26:31,859 --> 02:26:34,500
by its own will or after persuasion by

3176
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:36,000
the leaders

3177
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,319
will come to the idea of self-restrained

3178
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:42,780
it's so hard we want to consume more but

3179
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:44,640
you have to

3180
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:47,580
unless you will come to this stage when

3181
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:50,040
as we say in Russia if Sahara Desert

3182
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:52,080
ever becomes a communist state there

3183
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:54,560
will be shortage of sand

3184
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:58,939
so you have to curb your

3185
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:04,700
you have to you have to curb your

3186
02:27:04,700 --> 02:27:07,740
expectations at this point

3187
02:27:07,740 --> 02:27:10,200
before it's too late but no we don't

3188
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:11,700
want to do it

3189
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:14,880
demolition process again it's the

3190
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,680
easiest thing to reverse

3191
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:18,780
first of all

3192
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:22,319
by restricting import of propaganda the

3193
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:25,220
easiest thing to do

3194
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:28,859
unlimited unrestrained import of Soviet

3195
02:27:28,859 --> 02:27:31,760
literature Soviet journalists

3196
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:34,979
uh giving solids propaganda and

3197
02:27:34,979 --> 02:27:37,380
ideological agitators equal time on

3198
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:39,540
American TV network

3199
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:41,819
it has to be stopped

3200
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:44,340
and it's easy they won't they won't be

3201
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:46,859
offended minded as a matter of fact they

3202
02:27:46,859 --> 02:27:49,920
will respect America more

3203
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,140
but then my former colleague Vladimir

3204
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:54,780
Posner appears on Nightline and Ted kof

3205
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:56,880
will ask him well Jim what do you think

3206
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:59,880
about this and what can he think he's an

3207
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:01,859
instrument of propaganda he thinks what

3208
02:28:01,859 --> 02:28:03,960
what comrade and drop off tells him to

3209
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:04,819
think

3210
02:28:04,819 --> 02:28:08,160
he's just a nice articulate mouthpiece

3211
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:11,580
of the Soviet subversion system and that

3212
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:14,340
couple makes you believe that my friend

3213
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:18,720
Vladimir Posner thinks

3214
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:26,939
the process of demoralization may not

3215
02:28:26,939 --> 02:28:31,500
have started at all if at that point

3216
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:33,180
the country

3217
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:36,060
which is a recipient of subversion

3218
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:37,800
actively

3219
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:40,620
not violently but actively prevents

3220
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:43,859
importation of foreign ideology

3221
02:28:43,859 --> 02:28:46,439
I don't want America to follow the

3222
02:28:46,439 --> 02:28:48,840
pattern of ancient Japan you don't have

3223
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:50,640
to shoot every Foreigner when It

3224
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:53,160
approaches the sacred borders of the

3225
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:54,540
United States

3226
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:57,660
but when he offers you a junk in the

3227
02:28:57,660 --> 02:29:00,180
disguise of very shiny something

3228
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:03,479
you have to tell him no we have our own

3229
02:29:03,479 --> 02:29:06,080
junk

3230
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:15,060
if at that point

3231
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:18,359
the society is strong Brave and

3232
02:29:18,359 --> 02:29:20,640
conscientious enough

3233
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:23,640
to stop impartation of ideas which are

3234
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:26,120
foreign

3235
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:29,880
then the whole chain of events could be

3236
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:31,439
prevented

3237
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:34,319
recently I've been to Philippines and I

3238
02:29:34,319 --> 02:29:36,180
was shocked

3239
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:39,359
how invix it is like Manila children

3240
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:42,479
listen to deafening music

3241
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:44,100
a melodious

3242
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:48,420
Nation with long traditions of good nice

3243
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:52,140
ethnic music introduced by Spanish long

3244
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:54,960
time ago maybe two centuries three

3245
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:57,359
centuries ago I don't remember all of a

3246
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,899
sudden listen to musical garbage

3247
02:30:00,899 --> 02:30:03,960
sing their radios at full blast at the

3248
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:06,899
full volume why

3249
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:10,260
in India I spent many years

3250
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:12,960
watching the reactions of Indians

3251
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:16,500
walking out of movie theaters after

3252
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:19,260
seeing Hollywood production

3253
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:22,260
they they couldn't figure out why

3254
02:30:22,260 --> 02:30:24,600
Americans are so wasteful they smashed

3255
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:27,120
their cars their shiny cars every five

3256
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,700
minutes how come they shoot each other

3257
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:32,100
for half million dollars

3258
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:35,660
is it true that they are so sexy

3259
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:38,819
I mean obsessed with sex

3260
02:30:38,819 --> 02:30:41,939
can you imagine showing a movie where

3261
02:30:41,939 --> 02:30:44,700
each five minutes there's a copulation

3262
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:47,220
on the screen to a country like India

3263
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:50,000
with long Traditions tradition of of

3264
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,399
respect to this private matter is or to

3265
02:30:53,399 --> 02:30:56,060
Pakistan

3266
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,700
and United States expect these people to

3267
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:01,200
respect you

3268
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:04,140
no way oh yes they will see the movie

3269
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:05,760
they'll pay five Rupees to see that

3270
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:07,920
garbage but they walk out and will tell

3271
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:09,899
their kids don't

3272
02:31:09,899 --> 02:31:12,060
respect Americans don't be like

3273
02:31:12,060 --> 02:31:13,500
Americans

3274
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:18,240
see so the process of demoralization

3275
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:21,420
could be stopped right here

3276
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:25,319
both as an expert and as an emperor and

3277
02:31:25,319 --> 02:31:29,100
that takes one step one very important

3278
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:31,620
thing to do you don't have to expel all

3279
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:34,920
the KGB Agents from Washington DC

3280
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:37,200
the most difficult and at the same time

3281
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:39,120
the simplest answer

3282
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,700
to the subversion is to start it here

3283
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:45,080
and even before

3284
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:49,920
by bringing back the society to religion

3285
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:52,800
something that you cannot touch and eat

3286
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:54,359
and put on yourself

3287
02:31:54,359 --> 02:31:56,939
but something that rules society and

3288
02:31:56,939 --> 02:31:59,880
makes it move and preserve it

3289
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:01,880
a Soviet scientist

3290
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:05,040
who has nothing to do with religion he

3291
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,380
is a computer scientist

3292
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:10,319
did a very intensive research on the

3293
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:12,899
history of socialist countries

3294
02:32:12,899 --> 02:32:15,240
he calls socialist or Communists any

3295
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:18,000
country with the centralized economy and

3296
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,180
the pyramidal style of power structure

3297
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:22,979
and he discovered

3298
02:32:22,979 --> 02:32:25,080
actually he didn't Discover it he just

3299
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:27,899
brought to attention of his readers that

3300
02:32:27,899 --> 02:32:30,979
civilizations like Mohenjo-daro

3301
02:32:30,979 --> 02:32:34,680
in the river Hindus area

3302
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:38,819
like Egypt like Maya Incas

3303
02:32:38,819 --> 02:32:39,920
like

3304
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:42,420
Babylonian culture collapsed and

3305
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:45,180
disappeared from the surface of

3306
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:48,180
the moment they lost religion

3307
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:50,300
as simple as that they disintegrated

3308
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:53,580
nobody remembers about them anymore well

3309
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:55,020
distantly

3310
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:57,800
so

3311
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:01,740
the ideas are moving society and keeping

3312
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:05,460
mankind as as a society of human beings

3313
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:07,140
intelligent

3314
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:10,880
moral agents of God

3315
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:14,819
the facts the truth the exact knowledge

3316
02:33:14,819 --> 02:33:16,439
may not

3317
02:33:16,439 --> 02:33:18,479
all the sophisticated technology and

3318
02:33:18,479 --> 02:33:21,000
computers will not prevent Society from

3319
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:25,200
disintegrating and eventually dying out

3320
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:27,000
have you ever met a person who would

3321
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:30,359
sacrifice his life freedom

3322
02:33:30,359 --> 02:33:33,680
for the truth like that

3323
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:36,000
this is truth

3324
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,859
I never met the person who said this is

3325
02:33:37,859 --> 02:33:41,780
truth and I'm ready to shoot me

3326
02:33:43,220 --> 02:33:48,060
to defend the truth hey

3327
02:33:48,060 --> 02:33:51,180
but Millions sacrifice their life

3328
02:33:51,180 --> 02:33:53,220
Freedom comfort

3329
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:55,319
everything

3330
02:33:55,319 --> 02:33:59,660
for things like God

3331
02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:02,700
like Jesus Christ

3332
02:34:02,700 --> 02:34:04,680
it's an horn

3333
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:06,899
some Martyrs in the Soviet concentration

3334
02:34:06,899 --> 02:34:09,060
camp died

3335
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,520
and they died in peace

3336
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:13,740
unlike those who shouted Long Live

3337
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:16,740
Stalin knowing perfectly well that he

3338
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:19,160
may not live long

3339
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:22,560
something which is

3340
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:24,420
something which is

3341
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:26,760
not Material

3342
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:31,500
moves society and helps it to survive

3343
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,840
and the other way around the moment we

3344
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:36,960
turn into two by two is four

3345
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:39,060
and make it a guiding principle of our

3346
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,700
life our existence

3347
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:43,439
we die

3348
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:46,080
even though this is true and this we

3349
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:47,760
cannot prove

3350
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:50,939
we only can feel and have faith in it

3351
02:34:50,939 --> 02:34:54,240
so the answer to ideological subversion

3352
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:57,240
strangely enough is very simple you

3353
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:58,859
don't have to shoot people you don't

3354
02:34:58,859 --> 02:34:59,760
have

3355
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:03,600
to aim missiles and pershings and cruise

3356
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:07,140
missiles at on drop of headquarters

3357
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:09,960
you simply have to have faith

3358
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:12,300
and prevent subversion

3359
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:14,220
in other words

3360
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:16,859
not to be a victim of subversion

3361
02:35:16,859 --> 02:35:20,819
don't try to be a person who in Judo is

3362
02:35:20,819 --> 02:35:23,399
trying to smash your enemy and being

3363
02:35:23,399 --> 02:35:26,160
caught by your hand

3364
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:29,640
don't strike like that strike with the

3365
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:33,060
power of spirit and moral superiority

3366
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:34,859
if you don't have that power it's high

3367
02:35:34,859 --> 02:35:36,600
time to develop it

3368
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:39,859
and that's the only answer

3369
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:41,250
thank you

3370
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:44,920
[Applause]

3371
02:35:48,180 --> 02:36:11,099
[Applause]

3372
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:13,979
can you describe how a concept is

3373
02:36:13,979 --> 02:36:16,319
formulated turned into propaganda and

3374
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:18,060
then ends up on someone's bumper sticker

3375
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:19,800
or in a newspaper what's the

3376
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:21,899
step-by-step process the other thing is

3377
02:36:21,899 --> 02:36:23,580
how close is the put Bureau to the

3378
02:36:23,580 --> 02:36:26,960
actual propaganda creating process and

3379
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:31,620
finally uh the 007 incident was notable

3380
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:33,240
in the fact that it took a long time

3381
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:35,399
before the Soviets responded to it and

3382
02:36:35,399 --> 02:36:38,100
then the military took the lead in terms

3383
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:39,479
of explaining what had happened rather

3384
02:36:39,479 --> 02:36:41,700
than the political organs and I wanted

3385
02:36:41,700 --> 02:36:45,420
to know why that actually happened okay

3386
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:47,880
now the propaganda concepts are not

3387
02:36:47,880 --> 02:36:50,040
being developed they have been developed

3388
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:52,560
long time ago there's nothing basically

3389
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:57,840
new in the concept of overall propaganda

3390
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:00,120
methods and goals

3391
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:03,180
the ultimate goal however ridiculous it

3392
02:37:03,180 --> 02:37:05,399
may sound or primitive or simplistic is

3393
02:37:05,399 --> 02:37:07,500
the world domination

3394
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,780
many people

3395
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:12,600
many experts in foreign policy would

3396
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:15,240
ridicule my opinion but this is what it

3397
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:17,700
is I saw it with my own eyes I was a

3398
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:19,500
part of that

3399
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:22,140
so and my father was I think I mentioned

3400
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:24,540
that before he was a inspector of land

3401
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:26,520
forces he traveled all over the world

3402
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:28,140
where the Soviet troops were stationed

3403
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:30,240
so he knows perfectly well that the

3404
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,620
troops are not stationed there to

3405
02:37:31,620 --> 02:37:33,840
collect Harvest for Cubans

3406
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:37,080
or or to help afghanis to

3407
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:40,500
to develop the uh what the chords of

3408
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:43,800
cattle or with goats they are there for

3409
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:46,080
one purpose world domination

3410
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:49,439
the concepts the immediate issues or

3411
02:37:49,439 --> 02:37:52,979
problems are created of course

3412
02:37:52,979 --> 02:37:55,680
for propaganda purposes and they end up

3413
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:58,680
as a bumper stickers

3414
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:03,240
probably not uh long uh it takes really

3415
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,280
short period of time

3416
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:07,800
unlike some other things in in the

3417
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,740
Soviet system

3418
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:13,020
propaganda takes propaganda is one of

3419
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:15,780
the things that they don't save money on

3420
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:19,979
and there is a huge apparatus of

3421
02:38:19,979 --> 02:38:22,800
propagandam experts in USSR known as The

3422
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:25,140
Press agency is just one of them one of

3423
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:27,660
the organizations but the part with them

3424
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:29,760
that there is a Department of Education

3425
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:31,560
and propaganda

3426
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,840
with this within the Central Committee

3427
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:35,939
there are faceless people names of whom

3428
02:38:35,939 --> 02:38:38,700
you will never learn uh they're kind of

3429
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:40,080
classified

3430
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:43,859
uh I didn't explain you the methods

3431
02:38:43,859 --> 02:38:45,180
today because it will take us another

3432
02:38:45,180 --> 02:38:47,280
day the methods include such thing as

3433
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,920
semantic manipulation

3434
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,020
the words and expressions are being

3435
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:54,240
coined at the rate of five

3436
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:57,960
Expressions a minute by extremely clever

3437
02:38:57,960 --> 02:39:00,300
educated experts

3438
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:03,780
and the media outside of USSR obediently

3439
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:06,420
repeats this cliche I give you just

3440
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:08,760
several examples not not to take your

3441
02:39:08,760 --> 02:39:10,979
time not to bore you to death okay I

3442
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:14,100
mentioned one thing United Nations the

3443
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:16,260
expression was invented by the Soviet

3444
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:19,319
propaganda experts not by Americans

3445
02:39:19,319 --> 02:39:21,479
we know perfectly well it's not United

3446
02:39:21,479 --> 02:39:23,760
and it has nothing to do with Nations

3447
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,280
more than half of the delegations in

3448
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:31,740
Yuan do not represent any Nation at all

3449
02:39:31,740 --> 02:39:34,680
they are disunited obviously

3450
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:37,200
the United Nations had not been able to

3451
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:40,380
solve a single military conflict nowhere

3452
02:39:40,380 --> 02:39:42,859
in the world

3453
02:39:42,859 --> 02:39:45,780
they provoked War yes they took part in

3454
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:48,060
Wars but they didn't prevent expansion

3455
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:50,819
of Communism or or they did not prevent

3456
02:39:50,819 --> 02:39:55,319
a single War anywhere so the true

3457
02:39:55,319 --> 02:39:57,180
expression the true term for United

3458
02:39:57,180 --> 02:39:58,740
Nations could be this United

3459
02:39:58,740 --> 02:40:01,740
bureaucracies

3460
02:40:03,140 --> 02:40:06,840
okay another cliche which was coined in

3461
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:09,420
Moscow by experts of propaganda

3462
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:12,840
National Liberation movement

3463
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:15,120
it's not National because most of the

3464
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:16,080
leaders

3465
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:18,780
do do not necessarily belong to the

3466
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:19,680
ethnic

3467
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:22,020
Group which they lead

3468
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:23,700
number one number two they are

3469
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:25,979
unpatriotic and unnationalistic because

3470
02:40:25,979 --> 02:40:29,700
they they obey orders from a foreign

3471
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:31,500
country USSR

3472
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:34,200
okay they are trained in USSR they are

3473
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:36,840
paid by the Soviet system and they work

3474
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:38,359
in the interests of the Soviet system

3475
02:40:38,359 --> 02:40:41,880
Liberation whom they are liberating who

3476
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:44,160
is being liberated

3477
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:46,080
and movement movement we understand

3478
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:49,140
there's something which moves

3479
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:51,300
unlike something which is static

3480
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:54,180
National Liberation does not move it's a

3481
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:55,260
war

3482
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:57,720
if you if you call War movement probably

3483
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:59,700
but it has nothing to do with the

3484
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:01,439
concept of movement in in American

3485
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:04,560
terminology means a legitimate overt

3486
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:06,840
organized voluntary

3487
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:10,260
uh movement right I presume your your

3488
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:12,479
church or your organization is voluntary

3489
02:41:12,479 --> 02:41:15,000
nobody keeps you here by force

3490
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,760
okay National Liberation movement is an

3491
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:20,819
army of Bandits professional Bandits

3492
02:41:20,819 --> 02:41:22,859
which are kept kept in within the

3493
02:41:22,859 --> 02:41:25,800
framework of the movement by force

3494
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:28,200
if they betray it's like in Mafia

3495
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:30,600
they're going to be executed

3496
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:33,540
okay another example of semantic

3497
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,920
manipulation

3498
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:38,460
is uh okay

3499
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:40,080
um

3500
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:43,620
free medical aid for example

3501
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:45,240
you think it's it's an American

3502
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:48,359
Democratic expression no way this the

3503
02:41:48,359 --> 02:41:51,240
journal was coined by by the Communists

3504
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:53,220
long time ago at the time of commentary

3505
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:55,620
there is nothing free in this world

3506
02:41:55,620 --> 02:41:58,020
everybody knows it

3507
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:59,939
list of all Medical Aid it's very

3508
02:41:59,939 --> 02:42:02,220
expensive thing to render medical

3509
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:05,040
assistance to other people too

3510
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:07,800
Somebody Sometime somewhere has to pay

3511
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:10,560
for who taxpayer

3512
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:13,020
all this there are many other things

3513
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:15,240
that are being coined by by the Soviet

3514
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:17,880
propaganda apparatus unfortunately see

3515
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:20,760
if I call myself a genius

3516
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:23,700
a genius writer for example

3517
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:26,520
Los Angeles Times would not call me that

3518
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:29,520
right they'll call me a strange crazy

3519
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:33,300
Russian who calls himself a genius

3520
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:36,720
hell they call Liberation movements what

3521
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:39,240
what what they call themselves

3522
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:42,060
just because they are men

3523
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:45,120
the logic is Twisted

3524
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,380
um

3525
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:48,240
they

3526
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:50,880
stickers on on the bumpers I don't know

3527
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:53,460
it it depends on the ability of local

3528
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:55,100
forces to

3529
02:42:55,100 --> 02:42:58,620
toe up to the foreign policy how close

3530
02:42:58,620 --> 02:43:01,920
is police Bureau to to implementation of

3531
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:05,040
propaganda actions very distant see

3532
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,560
police Bureau is a group of self-imposed

3533
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:09,060
dictators

3534
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:12,060
they don't really decide anything

3535
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:15,300
the only objective of the existence in

3536
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:17,640
their life and their struggle is to stay

3537
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:19,080
in power

3538
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:21,300
unlike American politician who has two

3539
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:23,220
objectives first to be elected and

3540
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:25,280
second to be re-elected

3541
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:28,560
so the soil

3542
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:30,660
the Soviet politician doesn't have the

3543
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:32,340
first objective

3544
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:35,700
he does not have to be elected

3545
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:38,100
he just makes his way in the parking

3546
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:40,140
structure all the way up the election

3547
02:43:40,140 --> 02:43:42,540
doesn't bother him at all so the only

3548
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:45,120
purpose of his life is to stay where he

3549
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,920
is and Don't Rock the Boat

3550
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,479
they don't make decisions the

3551
02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:51,000
decision-making level are the faceless

3552
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,920
group of experts as I as I try to

3553
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:56,580
explain to you and they the the police

3554
02:43:56,580 --> 02:43:59,280
Bureau gives only the basic directions

3555
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:01,560
what to be done and the obedient

3556
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:03,359
Servants of the highest caliber

3557
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:05,819
intellectuals are beautifully developing

3558
02:44:05,819 --> 02:44:07,819
these things

3559
02:44:07,819 --> 02:44:11,120
some independently thinking Progressive

3560
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:13,439
academics in the United States think

3561
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:15,600
that comes socialism they will be able

3562
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:18,120
to preserve the integrity and

3563
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:21,240
Independence it's wishful thinking there

3564
02:44:21,240 --> 02:44:23,939
will become obedient Servants of the

3565
02:44:23,939 --> 02:44:25,439
system that they are trying to force

3566
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:27,020
upon you

3567
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:30,300
the Korean airliner incident

3568
02:44:30,300 --> 02:44:33,120
from my viewpoint is not an incident at

3569
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,540
all I believe it's it's a it's a

3570
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:39,180
carefully planned

3571
02:44:39,180 --> 02:44:43,080
and premeditated provocation

3572
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:45,720
I'm not sure whether they did it they

3573
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:49,080
killed to 268 people just to get rid of

3574
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:52,620
Larry McDonald but it's feasible I

3575
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:54,500
wouldn't be surprised if they killed

3576
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:57,899
more than 60 millions of their own men

3577
02:44:57,899 --> 02:44:59,700
just to implement

3578
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:02,880
growth and ideas of marks and angles you

3579
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:06,120
know what what what would 2168 people

3580
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:08,540
matter

3581
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:12,120
second it is not a military blunder and

3582
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:14,580
and the order was not given by military

3583
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:17,760
never a single military officer of a

3584
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:19,680
highest caliber will take responsibility

3585
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:22,380
to shoot a civilian airliner my father

3586
02:45:22,380 --> 02:45:24,479
was an officer of general staff of the

3587
02:45:24,479 --> 02:45:26,760
Soviet Army I know perfectly well what

3588
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:29,460
I'm talking about no officer would take

3589
02:45:29,460 --> 02:45:31,080
responsibility it'll be short tomorrow

3590
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:33,660
you're kidding it's the order was given

3591
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:37,080
by a civilian by party apparatchik of a

3592
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:38,939
highest caliber and I wouldn't be

3593
02:45:38,939 --> 02:45:41,939
surprised it was androco in any case a

3594
02:45:41,939 --> 02:45:44,040
drop of knew perfectly well what goes on

3595
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:46,380
what goes on what went on

3596
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:49,200
the Soviet power structure resembles a

3597
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:52,560
triangle unlike a love triangle in in

3598
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:55,800
real life drama it's a hate triangle

3599
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:58,740
the the seats of Power are party

3600
02:45:58,740 --> 02:46:01,140
Communist Party

3601
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:03,359
Elite of course not the rank and file

3602
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:06,899
party but the top of the pyramid the KGB

3603
02:46:06,899 --> 02:46:10,200
and the military they hate each other

3604
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:13,260
and each of them hate the other two

3605
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:14,880
the more

3606
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:17,340
the most powerful is the party this is

3607
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,899
the real power

3608
02:46:18,899 --> 02:46:21,479
the Army and the KGB supposedly are

3609
02:46:21,479 --> 02:46:23,700
Servants of the party and the tools the

3610
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:26,040
instruments of their power but in fact

3611
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:30,420
sometimes they are the power themselves

3612
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:32,700
andropov belongs to the most hated

3613
02:46:32,700 --> 02:46:36,960
triangle the KGB my father hated KGB

3614
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:38,520
because he was military

3615
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,920
both of them KGB and Military hate the

3616
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:42,180
party why

3617
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:45,120
because unlike in the United States

3618
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:47,939
the party is the most adventuristic

3619
02:46:47,939 --> 02:46:51,000
people they want to invade countries

3620
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,040
they give the orders for all kind of

3621
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:56,040
Adventures outside of ussrb waters

3622
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:58,080
they know perfectly well that comes War

3623
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:00,180
they will go to bankers and eat caviar

3624
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:02,399
and enjoy life whereby military will

3625
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:06,800
burn in flames of nuclear war

3626
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:09,660
was against Invasion into Czechoslovakia

3627
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:11,100
because he knew that

3628
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:13,800
he will have to demoralize his Army and

3629
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:16,380
the first two divisions after facing the

3630
02:47:16,380 --> 02:47:18,660
reality and seeing that Czechoslovakia

3631
02:47:18,660 --> 02:47:20,460
is not being invaded by Americans will

3632
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:22,620
get corrupted so you have to replace

3633
02:47:22,620 --> 02:47:25,500
them with other two divisions and if you

3634
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:27,660
stay long enough you will corrupt the

3635
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:30,240
whole Soviet Army he said no don't

3636
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:32,340
invade your Slovakia but comrade

3637
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:35,399
yourself who the hell they are they

3638
02:47:35,399 --> 02:47:37,200
think they they deserve more sausages

3639
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:40,020
and butter so show them tanks so he did

3640
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:41,340
he obeyed

3641
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:46,439
uh the the KGB the KGB and the Army

3642
02:47:46,439 --> 02:47:48,960
sometimes are in cahoots against the

3643
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:51,780
party the recent rumor that andropo was

3644
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:53,340
shot

3645
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:57,180
by son of Brezhnev is an indication that

3646
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:59,580
the the other two corners of the power

3647
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:00,960
structure

3648
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:04,080
were really sick and tired of of the of

3649
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:06,720
the andropos KGB purges

3650
02:48:06,720 --> 02:48:08,700
you know they were purges the many

3651
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:10,380
people lost their jobs and some were

3652
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:12,899
arrested and some committed suicide in

3653
02:48:12,899 --> 02:48:14,960
the span of some ten

3654
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:18,060
ten months since I'm drop off a sentence

3655
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:20,540
to power so that gives you an idea of

3656
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:23,359
the Korean airliner incident is

3657
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:26,819
premeditated provocation to create an

3658
02:48:26,819 --> 02:48:29,040
international pension

3659
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:32,880
because the only power on Earth which is

3660
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:35,880
interested in provoking conflicts and

3661
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:38,819
preserving tension is the Soviet junta

3662
02:48:38,819 --> 02:48:41,340
that's the only justification of them

3663
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:44,220
being in power if there is no enemy

3664
02:48:44,220 --> 02:48:47,399
outside they have to create him

3665
02:48:47,399 --> 02:48:49,680
if there is no word they have to provoke

3666
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:50,819
it

3667
02:48:50,819 --> 02:48:53,220
to scare the hell out of taxpayers

3668
02:48:53,220 --> 02:48:54,120
inside

3669
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:58,160
and to keep themselves in power

3670
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:03,060
there are so many theories one of them

3671
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:06,420
is expressed by I wouldn't say a friend

3672
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:08,160
of mine but I know he made it there's

3673
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:10,620
another Defector Nikolai

3674
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:13,020
who defected long time before I even

3675
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:14,760
joined KGB

3676
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:18,060
he was also a KGB in Western Europe

3677
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:20,819
now he is teaching psychology in one of

3678
02:49:20,819 --> 02:49:22,740
California universities he thinks that

3679
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:24,680
the Soviet Union developed

3680
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:28,020
ESP would you believe it system of

3681
02:49:28,020 --> 02:49:30,600
influencing the perception and minds of

3682
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:31,859
people

3683
02:49:31,859 --> 02:49:35,640
and the the generators of ESP willpower

3684
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:38,580
can be focused on individuals and groups

3685
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:41,220
of individuals so efficiently that you

3686
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:44,280
can literally Focus that beam or

3687
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:45,660
whatever it is

3688
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:49,080
on a pilot or two pilots or three pilots

3689
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:51,060
and convince them that actually they're

3690
02:49:51,060 --> 02:49:52,979
flying on the safe territory so there is

3691
02:49:52,979 --> 02:49:54,479
no need you can convince them that

3692
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:56,760
there's no need to to contact the the

3693
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:59,040
ground base station

3694
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:00,979
and you can

3695
02:50:00,979 --> 02:50:04,020
artificially draw the plane by brain

3696
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:06,479
wave into the Soviet airspace whether it

3697
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:09,120
is true or not I don't know but I know

3698
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:11,760
one thing that when I was a student and

3699
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,380
I graduated from Oriental Studies

3700
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:15,859
Institute one of my friends he was a

3701
02:50:15,859 --> 02:50:19,140
extremely intelligent Jewish boy he

3702
02:50:19,140 --> 02:50:21,560
graduated from the mathematical

3703
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:24,479
Department of Moscow State University

3704
02:50:24,479 --> 02:50:27,420
after three years I returned from India

3705
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:31,319
for for vacation and I met him in the

3706
02:50:31,319 --> 02:50:33,899
on during the reception at the Academy

3707
02:50:33,899 --> 02:50:35,700
of Science and I say what are you doing

3708
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:38,340
here he said I'm working in a secret

3709
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:40,800
research Bureau

3710
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:43,140
you know the secret which means

3711
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:46,859
basically defense industry they don't

3712
02:50:46,859 --> 02:50:49,620
have addresses they have post box number

3713
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:51,780
and I say if it's not is it that much

3714
02:50:51,780 --> 02:50:53,220
secret that you cannot tell me what your

3715
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:54,359
research you said you wouldn't believe

3716
02:50:54,359 --> 02:50:56,520
me brain veins

3717
02:50:56,520 --> 02:50:59,899
and I never saw him again

3718
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:04,080
ESP which officially in the Soviet media

3719
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:05,100
is

3720
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:08,040
described as a pseudoscience and

3721
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:11,460
decadent capitalist gimmick to Sidetrack

3722
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:14,280
