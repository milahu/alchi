1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,960
understand what's going on around you

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,839
you are in a state of war and you have

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,480
precious

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,599
little time to save yourself is a slow

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,240
process

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,960
which we call active measures what

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,480
matters is essentials

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,119
economy foreign relations defense

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,720
systems

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,000
with a violent change of power structure

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
and economy period of normalization

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
this is what will happen in the united

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
states if you allow all these schmucks

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
to put a big brother government

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
in washington dc who will promise lots

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,000
of things

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
never mind whether the promises are

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,840
fulfillable or not

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
the disaster is coming closer and closer

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,879
the danger

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,480
is real subversion is the term

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,879
if if you look in in a dictionary or

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,840
criminal code

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
to that matter usually is ex

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
is explained as a part of activity

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
to destroy

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
things like religion government

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,680
system political economical system of a

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
country

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
and usually it's linked to espionage and

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
such romantic things as blowing up

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
bridges side tracking trains

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
clock and dagger activity in hollywood

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,479
style

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
when what i'm going to talk about now

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,159
has

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
absolutely nothing to do with the cliche

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
of espionage or kgb activity of

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,119
collecting information

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,720
so the greatest mistake or mis

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
misconception i think is that uh

42
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
whenever we are talking about kgb for

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,560
some strange reason

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
uh starting from hollywood movie makers

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
to professors of political science

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
and quote-unquote experts on soviet

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,239
affairs or

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,200
cremonologists as they call themselves

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,480
they think that

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
the most desirable thing for andropov

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,239
and the whole kgb

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
is to steal blueprints of some

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,480
supersonic jet

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
bring it back to soviet union and

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,599
sell it to the soviet military

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,000
industrial complex

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
it's only partly true if if we take

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
the whole time money

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
and manpower that the soviet union

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
and kgb in particular spends

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
outside of ussr border we will discover

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
of course there are no official

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
statistics unlike with cia or fbi

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,879
that the espionage as such

65
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,200
occupies only 10 to 15 percent

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,480
of money time and manpower

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,680
15 percent

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,720
of the activity of kgb the rest 85

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
is always subversion

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
and unlike a dictionary of english

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
oxford dictionary

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,599
subversion in soviet terminology means

73
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,120
always a destructive

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
aggressive activity aimed to

75
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
destroy the country nation

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,120
or geographical area of your enemy

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
so there's no romantics in there

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,640
absolutely no blowing up bridges no

79
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
microfilms in coca-cola cans

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,599
nothing of that sort no james bond

81
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
nonsense

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
it's most of this activity is overt

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
legitimate and easily

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,799
observable if you give yourself time and

85
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,080
trouble to observe

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
it but according to the law

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
and law enforcement systems of the

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
western civilization

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,239
it's not a crime exactly because of

90
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,480
misconception

91
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
manipulation of terms we think that

92
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
subverter is a person who is going to

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
blow up our beautiful bridges

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,519
no subverter is a student who come for

95
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
exchange a diplomat

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
an actor an artist a journalist like

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
myself

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
was 10 years ago

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,360
now subversion

100
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
is an activity which

101
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600
is a two-way traffic

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
you cannot subvert an enemy which

103
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
doesn't want to be subverted

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
if you know history of japan for example

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,680
before uh 20th century japan was a

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
closed society

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
the moment a foreign boat comes to the

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
shores of japan

109
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,320
the imperial japanese army politely tell

110
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
them to get lost

111
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
and if american salesman comes to the

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,639
shore of japan

113
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
let's say 60 or 70 years from now back

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
and says oh i have a very beautiful

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
vacuum cleaner for you

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
you know with the good financing please

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,639
leave us we don't need your vacuum

118
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
cleaner

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
if they don't leave they shoot them

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
to preserve their culture ideology

121
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
traditions

122
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
values intact

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
you were not able to subvert japan

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
you cannot subvert soviet union because

125
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
the borders are closed

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
the media is censored by the government

127
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,160
the population is controlled by the kgb

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
and internal police with all the

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,639
beautiful glossy pictures of time

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,440
magazine

131
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
and magazine america which is published

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
by by the

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
uh american embassy in moscow you cannot

134
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,680
subvert soviet citizens because the

135
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
magazine never reaches

136
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
soviet citizens it's collected from the

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,520
new stance

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
and thrown to garbage can

139
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,840
subversion can be only successful when

140
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,800
the

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
initiator the actor the act the agent of

142
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
subversion

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
has a responsive target

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,520
it's a two-way traffic united states is

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,600
a receptive target of subversion

146
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,520
there is no response similar to that one

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
from united states to the soviet union

148
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,319
it stops halfway somewhere it never

149
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
reaches here

150
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
the theory of subversion goes all the

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
way back

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
2 500 years ago

153
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,440
the first human being who formulated the

154
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
tactics of subversion was a chinese

155
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,800
philosopher

156
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
by the name of sun set

157
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,120
to 3500 years bc

158
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
it was an advisor for several imperial

159
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,680
courts in

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
ancient china and he said

161
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
after long meditation that

162
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,440
to implement foreign to implement

163
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,160
state policy in a warlike manner

164
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,599
it's the most counterproductive barbaric

165
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,840
and inefficient to fight on a

166
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,639
battlefield

167
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,319
you know that war is continuation of

168
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,080
state policy right so if you want

169
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
successfully to implement your state

170
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,440
policy

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
and you start fighting this is the most

172
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,440
idiotic way to do it

173
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
the highest arc of warfare is not

174
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
to fight at all

175
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,360
but to subvert anything of value in the

176
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,199
country of your enemy

177
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
until such time that the perception of

178
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,440
reality of your enemy

179
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
is screwed up to such an extent that he

180
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
does not perceive you as an

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
enemy and that your system

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,440
your civilization and your for ambitions

183
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
look to your enemy as an alternative

184
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
if not desirable then at least visible

185
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
better red than dead

186
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,919
that's the ultimate purpose the final

187
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
stage of subversion after which you can

188
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
simply take your enemy without a single

189
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
shot being fired

190
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
if the subversion is successful this is

191
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,360
basically what subversion is

192
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
as you see not the single mentioning of

193
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
blowing up bridges of course sunset

194
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,839
didn't know about

195
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,599
blowing up bridges maybe there were not

196
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
that many bridges at that time

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,720
but the basics

198
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
of subversion is being taught to every

199
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,560
student

200
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,000
of kgb school in ussr and to officers of

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
military academies

202
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
i'm not sure if the same offer is

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,080
included in the

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,240
list of breeding for american officers

205
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
to say nothing about ordinary students

206
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
of political science

207
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
i had difficulty to find the translation

208
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
of sunset

209
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,720
in in the library of a university

210
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,360
in toronto and later on here in los

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
angeles

212
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
but it's a it's a book which is not

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
available it is forced to every students

214
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
in ussr

215
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
every student who is who is taught to be

216
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,399
dealing further

217
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,959
in in his future career with foreigners

218
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,040
what's the version is basically it

219
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
consists of four

220
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
periods time wise

221
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,560
if we start from here and go this way

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
time right this is the beginning

223
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,959
point the first stage of subversion is

224
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,560
the process which is called

225
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,240
basically demoralization says for itself

226
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,839
what it is

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
it takes from um

228
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
say 15 to 20 years

229
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
to demoralize a society

230
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
why why 15 or 20 years this

231
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
is the time sufficient to educate

232
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
one generation

233
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
of students or children one generation

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
one lifetime span of a person a human

235
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
being

236
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
which is dedicated to study to shaping

237
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,120
up

238
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,360
the outlook ideology personality

239
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,880
no more no less usually it takes from 15

240
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
to 20 years

241
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,760
what it includes it includes

242
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,120
influencing or by various methods

243
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
infiltration

244
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
propaganda methods direct contacts

245
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
doesn't really matter

246
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
i will describe them later of various

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,279
areas where public opinion is formulated

248
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,040
or shaped

249
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
religion educational system

250
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,040
social life administration

251
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,399
law enforcement system military

252
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,480
of course and labor

253
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
and employer relations economy

254
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,839
okay five areas

255
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
i will not write them down because will

256
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
not have enough space

257
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,279
some sometimes when i describe all the

258
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,079
methods

259
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
uh students ask me question are you

260
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
sure this is the result of the soviet

261
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,360
influence

262
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
not necessarily you see the tactic of

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,279
subversion

264
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
about which i'm talking is similar to

265
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,519
the martial art

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
the japanese martial art if you're if

267
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,839
some of you familiar with that tactic

268
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,680
probably you will remember that if an

269
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
enemy is bigger and

270
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
heavier than yourself it would be very

271
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,480
painful

272
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
to resist his direct strike

273
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
if a heavier person wants to strike me

274
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,600
in the face

275
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
it would be very naive and

276
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
counterproductive to stop his blow

277
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,120
the chinese and japanese judo

278
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
art tells us what to do first to

279
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
avoid the strike then to grab the feast

280
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
and continue his movement in the

281
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,440
direction

282
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,040
where it was before right until the

283
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,320
enemy crashes in the wall you see

284
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,440
so what happens here the target country

285
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
obviously does something wrong if it's a

286
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
free democratic society

287
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,000
there are many different movements

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
within the society

289
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
that obviously in every society

290
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
there are people who are against this

291
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
society they may be simple criminals

292
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
ideologically in disagreement with the

293
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
state policy

294
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
conscientious enemies simply psychotic

295
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
personalities who are against anything

296
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
right and finally they're a small group

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,399
of agents of a foreign

298
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
nation bought subverted

299
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
recruited right the moment

300
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,040
all these movements will be directed in

301
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
one direction

302
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
right this is the time to catch that

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,079
movement and to continue

304
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,880
until the movement forces the whole

305
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,839
society

306
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
into collapse into crisis right so

307
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,360
that's exactly

308
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
the martial art tactic we don't stop

309
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,320
an enemy we let him go we help him to go

310
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,120
in the direction we want them to go okay

311
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,360
so on the stage of demoralization

312
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
obviously there are tendencies in each

313
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,560
society in each country which are going

314
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
to opposite direction from the basic

315
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
moral values and principles

316
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,519
to take advantage of these movements to

317
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,279
capitalize on them

318
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,760
is the main purpose of the originator of

319
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,199
subversion

320
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,040
so we have religion we have education

321
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,560
we have social life we have power

322
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
structure

323
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
we have labor relations unions and

324
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
finally we have

325
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,600
law and order one two three four five

326
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,399
six

327
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,279
okay these are the areas of application

328
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
of subversion

329
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
what it means exactly in case of

330
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
religion

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,800
destroy ridicule it replace it with

332
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
various sex cults which bring

333
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,639
people's attention faith whether it is

334
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,120
naive primitive doesn't really matter

335
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,240
as long as the basically accepted

336
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,079
religious dogma

337
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
is being slowly eroded and taken

338
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,160
away from the supreme purpose of

339
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,320
religion to keep people

340
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
in touch with with the supreme being

341
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
that serves the purpose

342
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,639
therefore accepted respected

343
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
religious organizations with fake

344
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
organizations

345
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,639
distract people attention from the real

346
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,360
faith

347
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,920
and attract them to various different

348
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,279
faiths

349
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,560
education distract them from learning

350
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
something which is constructive

351
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
pragmatic

352
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
efficient instead of mathematics physics

353
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,360
foreign languages

354
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,079
chemistry teach them history of urban

355
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
warfare

356
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
natural food

357
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,920
home economy your sexuality

358
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
anything long as it takes you away

359
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,959
okay uh social life

360
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,839
replace traditionally established

361
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
institutions and organizations with

362
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,720
fake organizations take away the

363
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
initiative from people

364
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
take away the responsibility from

365
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,240
naturally established links between

366
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
individuals group of individuals and

367
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,040
society at large

368
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,880
and replace them with artificially

369
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
bureaucratically controlled bodies

370
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,040
instead of social life and friendship

371
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
between neighbors

372
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
establish social workers

373
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,320
institutions the people who are on

374
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
payroll of whom

375
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
society no bureaucracy the main concern

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
of social workers is not your family not

377
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
you not social relations between groups

378
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,959
of people

379
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
the main concern is to get the paycheck

380
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
from the government what will be the

381
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
result of their social work doesn't

382
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,000
really matter

383
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
they can develop all kind of concepts

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
to show them to show to the government

385
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
and to the people that they are useful

386
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
okay away from the natural links

387
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,160
power structure okay the natural

388
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
bodies of administration which are

389
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,439
traditionally either elected by

390
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,919
by people at large or appointed by

391
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
elected leaders of society are being

392
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
actively substituted by artificial

393
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
bodies

394
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
the bodies of people groups of people

395
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,679
whom nobody elected

396
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
never as a matter of fact most of the

397
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,960
people

398
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,880
don't like them at all and yet they

399
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
exist

400
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,799
one of the such group is media who

401
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,440
elected them

402
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
how come how come they they face they

403
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
have so much power

404
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
almost monopolistic power on your mind

405
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,919
they can

406
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
rape your mind but who elected them how

407
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,200
come

408
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
they are they have a nerve to decide

409
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
what is good and what is bad for

410
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,840
for the elected by you president and his

411
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
administration

412
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
who the hell are they uh

413
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
spiro agnew who was hated by the liberal

414
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,039
left

415
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,320
called them a bunch of enfield snobs

416
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,480
and that's exactly what they are

417
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,520
they think they know they don't say

418
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,039
the level of mediocracy in a big

419
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,960
establishment like new york times los

420
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
angeles times

421
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
major television network you don't have

422
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
to be excellent journalist

423
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,120
you have to be exactly a mediocre

424
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
journalist that's easier to survive

425
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,559
there's no competition anymore

426
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,160
you have your good nice income 100

427
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,640
000 a year that's it whether you are

428
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
better or worse doesn't really matter

429
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
anymore as soon as you're smiling

430
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,360
to the camera and do your job

431
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,600
that's it no more no more competition

432
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
power structure slowly

433
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,200
is eroded by the bodies and groups of

434
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,840
people

435
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,400
who do not have neither qualification

436
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
nor the will of people

437
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,559
to keep them in power and yet they do

438
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,480
have power

439
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
okay together with that there is another

440
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
process

441
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
law enforcement law and order uh

442
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
organization and structure is being

443
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
eroded

444
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,200
for the last 20 25 years you you if you

445
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,520
see

446
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
old movies and new movies you can see

447
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,559
that

448
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,679
in new movies a policeman an officer of

449
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
the united states army looks

450
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,000
dumb angry psychotic paranoid

451
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,120
a criminal looks nice kind of well

452
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,640
he smokes hash and shoots the whatever

453
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,600
drug

454
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
but basically he's a nice human being

455
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
he's creative

456
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,400
and he's unproductive only because

457
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,160
society oppresses him

458
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,840
whereby a general pentagon is always by

459
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
definition a dumb

460
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,280
a war maniac a policeman is a

461
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,320
pig rude policeman he abuses his power

462
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
no a generality generalization like that

463
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,919
the hatred the mistrust to the

464
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
people who supposed to protect you and

465
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,400
enforce law and order

466
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,039
moral relativity the angel of warner

467
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,799
process lasted two years in los

468
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,280
angeles and yet there are still some

469
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
lawyers who say look

470
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
he's a nice character as a matter of

471
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
fact there was some witness who said

472
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,360
also a criminal who said well he's a

473
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,159
nice guy

474
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
i asked him one day to burn a house of

475
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,840
my enemy and he wouldn't do it

476
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,600
[Laughter]

477
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,880
a slow substitution of basic moral

478
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
principles

479
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,200
whereby a criminal is not a criminal

480
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,679
actually he's a defendant

481
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,280
even if his guilt is proven there is

482
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,880
still a doubt to kill or not to kill to

483
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,919
be or not to be

484
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
thy shall not kill yes but

485
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,080
this uh line may not necessarily be

486
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
applicable to a murderer

487
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
but i shall not murder that should be

488
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,159
the the presumption not not that

489
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,559
i shall not kill okay labor relations

490
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,640
at this stage within 15 to 20 years

491
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
we destroy the

492
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,919
traditionally established links of

493
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,919
bargaining between employer

494
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,440
and employee the classical marxist

495
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
leninist

496
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,440
theory of natural exchange of goods

497
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,039
a person a has five sacks of grain and

498
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,919
person b

499
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,960
has five pairs of shoes

500
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,120
and the natural exchange without money

501
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
is when they

502
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
bargain between each other and only with

503
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
the introduction of the third for

504
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,880
c an entirely

505
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
third foreign stranger who says no don't

506
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,559
give him

507
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
five sacks of bring give it to me and

508
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
you give me your five pairs of shoes and

509
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,159
i will distribute it accordingly

510
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,360
so the economy will go

511
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,799
this is the death of natural exchange

512
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
and that death of natural bargaining

513
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
well trade unions were established 100

514
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,400
years ago

515
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
the objective was to improve working

516
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
conditions and to protect the rights of

517
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,760
workers

518
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,159
from those employers who were abusing

519
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,320
their their right because they had more

520
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,679
money

521
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,720
objectively at that time initially the

522
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
trade union movement did work

523
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
what we see now is that the bargaining

524
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,320
process

525
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,840
is no longer resulting into in the

526
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,280
compromise which is leading objectively

527
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,480
to

528
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,559
betterment of working conditions and

529
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,520
increase of salary what we see

530
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,640
is that after each prolonged strike the

531
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,360
workers

532
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,720
lose even if they have 10 increase of

533
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,679
their salaries

534
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
they cannot catch up due to inflation

535
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
and due to missed time

536
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,720
more than that millions of people suffer

537
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,799
from that strike

538
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,000
because economy now is interdependent

539
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,200
it's intertwined like one body

540
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,919
if previously still workers say hundred

541
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,919
years ago could strike and nobody would

542
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,120
suffer

543
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,919
now it's impossible anymore if a garbage

544
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,080
collector strikes today

545
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
the rest of the multi-million city is

546
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,360
stinking

547
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,720
i mean that there's no more service

548
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,480
in quebec for example we had the

549
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
electricians who were on strike in the

550
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,799
middle

551
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
of winter you can freeze your bottom

552
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,679
and they still weren't strike did they

553
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,120
catch up with the celery no

554
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,840
they lost who benefited the leaders of

555
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
trade union

556
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
what is the motivation for strike

557
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,480
improving

558
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,440
improving our workers condition no

559
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
obviously it's not

560
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,679
then what is it ideology

561
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,039
to prove to these capitalists

562
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,440
and the obedient horde of workers like

563
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
sheep follow these people and they

564
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,120
cannot disobey why

565
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
because if they do you know what happens

566
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,200
to them tickets

567
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
murders shooting truck drivers by

568
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
pikachus in montreal for example i saw

569
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,640
with my own eyes when i was

570
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
correspondent of cbc

571
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,919
international canadian broadcasting

572
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
corporation when the workers of aircraft

573
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,440
factory

574
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
destroyed computers and and the

575
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,320
equipment in the factory

576
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
and they the administration employed

577
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,159
strike breakers

578
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,559
their cars were turned upside down and

579
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,480
burned

580
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,799
their houses were burned their kids were

581
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,320
intimidated and some

582
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
victims were there of that you can be

583
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,440
sure

584
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,720
why to improve conditions of workers

585
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
no ideology okay so

586
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,279
this is what happens basically

587
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,279
it may or may not happen without the

588
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,360
help of the soviet union

589
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
but the natural tendencies are being

590
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
greatly taken advantage of and

591
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,799
capitalized by the soviet propaganda

592
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,279
systems how

593
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
whenever trade union strikes we have

594
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
influx of propaganda

595
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,720
mass media ideological dissemination the

596
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,840
workers right

597
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
and we repeat it like parrots yes

598
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,080
workers right whose rights workers

599
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
no the the only freedom of worker to

600
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,840
sell his labor according to his own

601
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,080
desire and will is taken away from him

602
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,960
by whom

603
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,240
by trade union boss unlimited power

604
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
is given responsibility i want to sell

605
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
my labor not for 250 an hour but for two

606
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
dollars i don't have right

607
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,400
my freedom is denied to me i know that

608
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
if i sell my work

609
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
for 200 for two dollars an hour not for

610
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,279
three dollars now

611
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
i will compete better with it with the

612
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,400
other guy who is lazy

613
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,640
and more greedy i don't need two three

614
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,720
dollars i need only two dollars

615
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,679
no i was made to believe by media by

616
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,400
business

617
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
by advertising agencies that i need more

618
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,000
and more and more

619
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
have you ever heard any advertising on

620
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,559
tv to consume less

621
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,000
no no way

622
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,640
whether you need a six-cylinder car or

623
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,120
not

624
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,440
you have to buy it and hurry up

625
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,320
when i was driving here on the local

626
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,919
radio station

627
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
an excited announcer said you hurry up

628
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
rush and safe safe safe there is a

629
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,760
plenty house's sale

630
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,480
save by buying more

631
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,960
of course of course it would be too

632
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
naive to expect that kgb makes that

633
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
advertising agency

634
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,880
to do such a crazy commercial no of

635
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
course not

636
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
but what we did when i was working for

637
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,080
knowledge depressing

638
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,159
we would snow plow editorial offices

639
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
student organizations religious group

640
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,200
with literature

641
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
of class struggle may if if not directly

642
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,960
marxism then it is propaganda

643
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,720
then a propaganda of of a legitimate

644
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
aspirations of working class

645
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,880
betterment of life equality equality

646
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,000
mind you president kennedy once said

647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,919
people we will make america to believe

648
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,279
that people are born

649
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,799
equal are people born equal

650
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,440
is there any mentioning in the bible or

651
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,480
any other

652
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
holy scripture in any religion any

653
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
religion if you don't believe me go to

654
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,240
library and check it

655
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,640
there is not a single word about

656
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
equality

657
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,320
just the opposite by your deeds

658
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
god will judge you what you do is

659
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,159
important

660
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,760
the merit of your personality

661
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
you cannot legislate equality if you

662
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
want to be equal

663
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,760
you have to be equal you have to deserve

664
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,840
it

665
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,960
and yet we build our society on the

666
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
principle of equality we say people are

667
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,520
equal

668
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,600
we know it is false it's a lie

669
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,480
some people are tall and stupid others

670
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,200
are short

671
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:31,840
bold and clever

672
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,970
if we make them

673
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,060
[Laughter]

674
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,559
if we make them equal by force

675
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,640
if we put the principle of equality in

676
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
the basis of our social political

677
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
structure

678
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
it's the same thing as building a house

679
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
on sand

680
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
sooner or later it will collapse and

681
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
that's exactly what happens

682
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,159
and we as soviet propaganda makers are

683
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,039
trying to

684
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,200
push you in the direction which you go

685
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,720
yourself equality

686
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,840
yes the quality people are equal land of

687
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,880
equal opportunities

688
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,799
is it true or not think about it

689
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,640
equal opportunities should there be

690
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
equal opportunities

691
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,039
for me and for a lazy bastard who come

692
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,760
here

693
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
from some other country and immediately

694
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,679
registers as a welfare

695
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,039
uh recipient benefits i never received a

696
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,000
single dot no

697
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,720
sorry i did this once but i never

698
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
applied for welfare for the 13 years i

699
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
took any job

700
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,640
security guard journalist taxi driver

701
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,159
anything

702
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,760
well i was restless but some people

703
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
don't like it they

704
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
immediately so why should we be why

705
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
should we have equal opportunities

706
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,360
why the equal opportunity to

707
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,960
excel equal opportunity in equal

708
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,799
circumstances yes but we know people are

709
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,200
different to excel yes

710
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,679
provided we reach the same level of

711
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,039
excellency

712
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,320
perfection which is hypothetical distant

713
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,960
future

714
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,760
yes maybe but we know perfectly well

715
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,559
that

716
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,360
even with the best intentions people

717
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,159
could not

718
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,360
be equal why should we have equality in

719
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,520
in in the say legal system myself

720
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,600
i'm considering myself a law-abiding

721
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
citizen

722
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,919
and a person who comes here to rob and

723
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,880
shoot say

724
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,360
the united states administration on the

725
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,919
card

726
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,159
imported thousands of cuban criminals

727
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,880
they were non-criminal yet they were

728
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
accepted

729
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
do you think it's fair if myself and my

730
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,919
wife from philippines who work like

731
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
excuse me horse as a lab technician in

732
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,679
the hospital

733
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,159
should have the same rights as a

734
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,600
criminal film from cuba

735
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,799
why and yet we repeat as parents

736
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,519
equality equality equality

737
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,519
and the soviet propaganda system helps

738
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,279
us to believe that equality is something

739
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,720
which is desirable

740
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,799
democracy as it was established by

741
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,320
fathers of this country

742
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,519
of the system in the last century

743
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,880
is is not equality

744
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
is the system where different people

745
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
unequal people

746
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
have a chance to survive and help each

747
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,519
other

748
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,720
in constant competition in constant

749
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,039
perfection

750
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,360
not inequality which is superimposed

751
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,720
from from a

752
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
godfather or a nice person in washington

753
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,519
dc

754
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,640
and the absolute equality exists in

755
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,919
soviet union

756
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,559
quote unquote equality everybody is

757
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,519
equally

758
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,039
in dirt except some people are more

759
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,559
equal than the others in politburo

760
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,480
so the moment you you bring a country

761
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,559
to the point of almost total

762
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,399
demoralization when nothing

763
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,360
works anymore when you are not sure that

764
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,080
is right

765
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,200
or or wrong good and bad

766
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
but there's no division between evil and

767
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
good when even the

768
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,159
leaders of church sometimes say well

769
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,159
violence for the sake of justice

770
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,640
especially social justice is justified

771
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,000
in the countries like

772
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
nicaragua el salvador well maybe

773
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,640
rhodesia

774
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,880
and we listen to them and say yeah

775
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,760
probably

776
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,880
it's true is it true no it is not true

777
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
violence is not justified especially for

778
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,559
the sake of

779
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,200
quote-unquote social justice introduced

780
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,559
by marxist leninist

781
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,279
that is my former colleague from noah's

782
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,320
depressed agency

783
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,399
okay so where is that point the next

784
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,840
step is destabilization

785
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,120
again this word says for itself what it

786
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
is to destabilize

787
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,360
all the relations all the accepted

788
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
institutions

789
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
and organizations in the country of your

790
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
enemy how you do it

791
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,760
you don't have to send up a battalion of

792
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,320
kgb

793
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
agents to blow up bridges no you let

794
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,840
them do it themselves

795
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,559
the area of application is again it's

796
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:24,880
it's

797
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,080
it's narrower now not like the previous

798
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,880
case

799
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
the overt legitimate actions of the

800
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,519
of the kgb in this case would be

801
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,320
hardly noticeable there is no crime if a

802
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,480
professor who recently went to ussr

803
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,799
introduces a course of marxist leninism

804
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,760
in in a californian college for example

805
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
nobody is going to to come to his

806
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,799
doorstep and say okay

807
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,840
mister come you are under arrest no it's

808
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,640
not a crime

809
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
it's not even considered a moral crime

810
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,720
against your country

811
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,960
so the area of application here is

812
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,559
narrowing down

813
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,240
to economy again labor relations

814
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,559
right to law and order

815
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,078
plus military

816
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,639
and the economy law and order

817
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,760
yes and again the uh media but

818
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,719
uh wider scope little bit different i'll

819
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,280
explain

820
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,960
later okay basically three areas

821
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,520
economy the radicalization of

822
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,480
bargaining process if on that stage

823
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,560
we still could achieve theoretically

824
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,599
some positive

825
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,040
compromise between the negotiating sides

826
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,480
with with uh say uh

827
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,760
our arbitrary introduction of rb3

828
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,879
judges third side objectively judging

829
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,520
the

830
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,400
the demands of both sides here it's

831
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
radicalization

832
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,960
on this on the stage of destabilization

833
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,839
we cannot

834
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,720
come to compromise even within a family

835
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
the husband and wife couldn't figure out

836
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,320
which is better

837
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
husband wants his kids to eat at the

838
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,359
table and wife

839
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,160
wants him a child to roam around the

840
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,960
room and

841
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,200
and drop food all over the floor they

842
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,040
cannot come to compromise

843
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,680
unless they start a fight it's

844
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,440
impossible to reach a compromise

845
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,040
constructive compromise between

846
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
neighbors

847
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
some people say i don't like you to

848
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
watering your lawn at that time because

849
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
exactly at that time i'm walking my dog

850
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
and he's getting nervous

851
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,920
he cannot uh pass his bowels you know so

852
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
they cannot compromise they go to

853
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,839
a a civil court or something like that

854
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,240
radicalization of human relations

855
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,280
no more compromise fight fight fight

856
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,359
the normal traditionally accepted

857
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,000
relations are destabilized

858
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
the relations between teachers and

859
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
students

860
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,280
in schools and colleges fight

861
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
the the relations between in economical

862
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,119
sphere between

863
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,640
laborers and and employers are further

864
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,680
radicalized no more

865
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,280
acceptance of the legitimacy of demands

866
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,720
of workers

867
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,440
unlike japanese with the theory z if you

868
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
ever heard about it

869
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,400
when the workers are involved in

870
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
decision making process therefore they

871
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,880
don't have

872
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,720
uh moral incentive to to fight their uh

873
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,640
their bosses in united states is just

874
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,520
the opposite the harder is the fight the

875
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,400
better

876
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
the more heroic they looked when the

877
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,160
greyhound uh

878
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,920
network was on strike recently the

879
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,280
correspondence of local tv networks uh

880
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,000
all over the united states were

881
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
approaching these strikers and they say

882
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
oh yes we are doing something nice they

883
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
look like heroes and they were proud

884
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,200
there was some family uh the husband

885
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,960
was a bus driver now they decided in

886
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,400
in in the protest against the uh bosses

887
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,720
to

888
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,680
camp somewhere in the forest and they

889
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
were presented to the to the audience as

890
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
as a heroic nice people

891
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,320
you see the violent clashes between

892
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
passengers ticketers and and

893
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,480
the strikers are presented as something

894
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
normal

895
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,599
10 15 20 years ago we would we would be

896
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,920
we would be angry say why why why so

897
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,240
much hatred

898
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,000
today we are not we say well commonplace

899
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,119
radicalization militarization sometimes

900
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,160
as i explained on that stage i

901
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
took a step a little bit further

902
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,760
shooting people

903
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,960
okay law and order now

904
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,480
also is uh

905
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
pushed into the area where previously

906
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,160
people

907
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,119
settle their differences uh peacefully

908
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,200
and legitimately

909
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,200
now we are getting with this uh

910
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,320
court cases in the in the smallest

911
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,200
irrelevant cases we cannot solve our

912
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,119
problems anymore

913
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,680
the society at large becomes more and

914
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,079
more antagonistic

915
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,920
between individuals between groups of

916
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,200
individuals and the society at large

917
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,400
the media puts himself in the opposition

918
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,520
to the society

919
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,720
in general at large

920
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,640
separate alienated okay

921
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,359
on that stage you remember i was talking

922
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,599
a a couple of hours ago

923
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,880
about the sleepers that's when the

924
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,000
students

925
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
from say united states if they are

926
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,240
trained in lumumba university

927
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,760
or developing nations that's the

928
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
students i was dealing with are being

929
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
sent back

930
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,880
from the soviet union here or if they

931
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,960
were already in the united states in the

932
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,440
country

933
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,640
which is the object of subversion they

934
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,079
spring to action

935
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,359
the sleepers go up

936
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,200
they slept for 15 to 20 years

937
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
now they become leaders of groups

938
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,680
preachers uh

939
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,160
i don't know public public figures

940
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,200
prominently

941
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,520
they act they actively include

942
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
themselves in a political process

943
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,200
all of a sudden we see a homosexual

944
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,560
15 years ago he did his dirty job and

945
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,520
nobody cared

946
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,640
now he makes it a political issue he

947
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,280
demands

948
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,079
recognition respect human rights and

949
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,200
hiral is a

950
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
large group of people and there are

951
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,839
violent clashes between him and police

952
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:50,640
his group and

953
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,520
and ordinary people no matter what it's

954
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
black against white

955
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
yellows again green doesn't matter

956
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,119
where's the vision line goes

957
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,800
as long as this group come into

958
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
antagonistic clash

959
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,960
sometimes militantly sometimes with

960
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,480
firearms

961
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,440
that is the stabilization process the

962
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,800
sleepers

963
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,000
many of whom are simply kgb agents

964
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,040
become leaders of the process of

965
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
destabilization

966
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
doesn't mean that comrade andropov sends

967
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
comrade ivanov to the united states

968
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
the person who takes care is already

969
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
here

970
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
he's a respected citizen of united

971
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,680
states sometimes he gets

972
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,240
money from various foundations for his

973
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,599
legitimate

974
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,720
uh struggle for i don't know human

975
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,280
rights

976
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,040
women rights kid lib prison lib whatever

977
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,560
there are sympathetic americans who

978
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,280
donate their money to him

979
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
this could be like this stabilization

980
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,680
process usually leads directly

981
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,400
to the process of crisis in case of

982
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,960
developing nations

983
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,079
that's the area where i i was active

984
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,839
the process starts

985
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,119
when when the

986
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,480
legitimate bodies

987
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,920
of power the social structure collapse

988
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,960
it cannot function anymore

989
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,440
so instead we have artificial body

990
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,079
injected into society such as

991
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,040
non-elected committees you remember i

992
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,880
was talking about them here

993
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,520
social workers who are not elected by

994
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,200
people media who sell who are

995
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,960
self-appointed rulers of your

996
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,880
opinion uh some strange groups

997
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,680
uh which claim that they know how to

998
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,440
lead society forward

999
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,520
they don't usually all they care is how

1000
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,280
to collect the nations and

1001
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,240
and from and sell their own concocted

1002
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,119
ideology

1003
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,640
mixture of religion and ideology here

1004
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,800
we have all this artificial body

1005
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,160
claiming power

1006
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,079
if the power is denied to them they take

1007
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,560
it by force

1008
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,400
in case of iran for example all of a

1009
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,880
sudden we have revolutionary committees

1010
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
who what what kind of revolution there

1011
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,160
was no revolution yet

1012
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,880
and yet they had the committees they

1013
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,160
were taking power of

1014
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,480
of judgment they had they had the power

1015
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,720
of execution they had the power of

1016
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,000
of legislation and that they had the

1017
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,200
power of

1018
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,000
judicial all of them combined in one

1019
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
person who is half-baked intellectual

1020
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,079
sometimes graduated from harvard

1021
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,599
university or berkeley

1022
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,240
he comes back to his country and um he

1023
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,160
thinks that he knows the answer to all

1024
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,800
the social economical problems

1025
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,640
okay crisis is when society cannot

1026
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,480
function any more productively it

1027
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,200
collapses

1028
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,160
obviously that's the word for crisis so

1029
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,200
therefore

1030
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,640
the population at large is looking for a

1031
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,400
savior

1032
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,480
the religious groups are expecting a

1033
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,400
messiah to come

1034
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,760
the workers say we have family to feed

1035
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,920
let's have a strong government maybe

1036
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,000
socialist government centralized when

1037
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,200
when somebody put put their employers on

1038
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,000
their place

1039
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,040
and let us work we are sick and tired of

1040
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,400
going to strike and

1041
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,880
missing overtime and all that stuff we

1042
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,560
need some strong man

1043
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,240
strong government a leader

1044
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,520
a savior is needed population is sick

1045
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
and tired already

1046
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,720
and here we are we have a savior either

1047
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
a foreign nation comes in

1048
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,640
or the local group of leftists

1049
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,400
marxist no matter what they call

1050
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,800
themselves sandinista

1051
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,839
a reverend or some sort

1052
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,440
bishop musureva like in zimbabwe

1053
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,040
doesn't matter a savior comes and says i

1054
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,599
will

1055
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,839
lead you so we have two alternatives

1056
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,079
here

1057
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,839
civil war and invasion

1058
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,880
okay see how it goes

1059
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
civil war we know what it is lebanon is

1060
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,640
the best example

1061
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,280
the civil war which was artificially

1062
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,480
implanted

1063
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,319
in lebanon by injection of force of plo

1064
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,800
palestinian liberation organization

1065
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,880
invasion we have in many other countries

1066
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,000
like afghanistan

1067
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,760
name any east european country it was

1068
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,880
invaded by the soviet army

1069
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,640
but the result is the same the next

1070
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,680
stage is

1071
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,160
normalization normalization

1072
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,400
is a very ironic word of course

1073
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,240
it is borrowed from 1968 situation in

1074
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,760
czechoslovakia when the soviet

1075
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,040
propaganda

1076
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
and after them new york times declared

1077
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,800
the country is normalized

1078
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,640
the tanks moved into prague so there is

1079
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,200
no more prague spring there is no more

1080
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,359
violence normal normalization

1081
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,400
at that stage the

1082
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,720
self-appointed rulers of the society

1083
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,880
don't need any revolution anymore they

1084
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,839
don't need any radicalism anymore so

1085
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,720
this is the reverse from destabilization

1086
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,680
basically it is

1087
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,119
stabilizing the country by force

1088
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,079
so all these sleepers and activists and

1089
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,119
social workers and liberals

1090
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,079
and homosexuals and professors and

1091
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,920
marxists and levines

1092
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,640
are being eliminated physically

1093
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,000
sometimes

1094
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,400
they've done their job already okay they

1095
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,520
are not needed anymore

1096
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,520
the new rulers need stability to exploit

1097
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
the nation to exploit the country to

1098
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,359
take advantages

1099
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,160
of the victory okay so no more

1100
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,079
revolutionaries please

1101
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,680
and that's exactly what happens in

1102
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
number of countries you remember

1103
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,160
bangladesh

1104
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,680
this is the crisis in which i was

1105
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,599
instrumental first they had mujibur

1106
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,680
rahman

1107
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,400
in 1971 he was the leader of of people's

1108
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,280
party

1109
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,839
league with mustache like stalin he was

1110
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:22,800
in in

1111
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,240
russia many times in five years he was

1112
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,920
shocked by his former colleagues

1113
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,480
marxists

1114
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,560
he fulfilled his function in afghanistan

1115
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,400
it happened three times

1116
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
because there was taraki then there was

1117
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,599
amin nowadays

1118
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,640
they killed each other successively one

1119
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,520
after another

1120
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,680
the moment he fulfills his duty the

1121
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,920
first one demoralized country the second

1122
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,960
distabilized

1123
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,119
the third one brought it to crisis

1124
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,599
goodbye comrade

1125
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,319
karma comes from moscow and put him into

1126
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,319
the seat of power

1127
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,040
same thing happened in grenada recently

1128
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,319
maurice bishop

1129
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,880
marxist was killed by austin what's his

1130
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,240
name general something

1131
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,000
it was also a marxism right

1132
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
so no more revolutions please

1133
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,760
normalization now

1134
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,560
from now on no more strikes no more

1135
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,599
homosexual

1136
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,319
sexuals no more women lived no more kid

1137
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,119
lived

1138
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,240
no more lib period

1139
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,000
good solid democratic proletarian

1140
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,480
freedom

1141
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,880
now to reverse this process

1142
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,800
takes enormous effort when today

1143
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,480
united states had to invade granada

1144
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,280
to reverse the process of subversion

1145
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,160
some people say

1146
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,720
boy this is not good it's not kosher to

1147
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,240
invade the beautiful country

1148
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,839
island of granada well why didn't you

1149
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,359
stop the process here

1150
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,359
when granada was just approached by

1151
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,800
leftists

1152
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,640
why not to prevent maurice bishop to

1153
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,240
come in power in the first place

1154
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,200
did grenadas want him very questionable

1155
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,880
they didn't know who was most bishop in

1156
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,680
the first place

1157
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,359
he came to power by coup d'etat himself

1158
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,160
okay now we let the situation develop

1159
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,440
further and for them further

1160
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,359
until the crisis and normalization very

1161
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,119
soon

1162
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,359
and then united states decided to invade

1163
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,720
country discovering that the

1164
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,960
the country was absolutely a military

1165
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,680
base for the soviet union

1166
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,359
of course it's a drastic measure of

1167
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,119
course it's repeated that

1168
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,079
marine corps had to lose what 17 lives

1169
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,599
very bad

1170
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,359
why not to stop the process before it

1171
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,880
comes to crisis

1172
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,280
or no intellectuals will not let you

1173
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,160
it's interference into domestic affairs

1174
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,880
they're very careful not to not not to

1175
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,280
let

1176
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,520
american administration to interfere in

1177
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,200
domestic affairs of latin american

1178
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,000
countries

1179
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
they don't mind soviet union interfere

1180
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,000
in this affair

1181
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,720
okay so to reverse this process from

1182
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,520
here

1183
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,839
it takes only and always military force

1184
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,480
no other force on earth can reverse this

1185
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,040
process at this point

1186
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,079
at this point it does not take military

1187
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:14,720
invasion

1188
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,839
of united states army it takes strong

1189
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,880
action like in chile

1190
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,319
a cia covert involvement

1191
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,040
to prevent the savior from outside to

1192
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,880
come into power

1193
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,800
and to stabilize country before it

1194
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,599
erupts into civil war

1195
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,280
okay support the right-wing conservative

1196
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,520
forces buy money by crooks so love

1197
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,800
doesn't matter

1198
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,640
stabilize the kind don't let the crisis

1199
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,760
develop into into civil war or invasion

1200
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,839
oh no your liberals will say it's

1201
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,319
against the law

1202
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,559
the congress will not appropriate money

1203
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,160
for covert actions

1204
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,280
of cia why not

1205
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,200
should we wait till the normalization

1206
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
come and soviet tanks landed in in los

1207
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,000
angeles airport

1208
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,160
now at that point at the point of

1209
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,280
destabilization

1210
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,760
also the process could be reversed again

1211
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,960
easily than this

1212
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,000
no cia involvement at this point you

1213
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,559
know what it takes here

1214
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,839
restriction of some liberties for small

1215
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,559
groups which are self-declared enemies

1216
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,000
of the society

1217
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,800
as simple as that oh no the median

1218
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,319
liberals will tell you this is against

1219
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,040
the american constitution

1220
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,680
how can we

1221
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,599
uh by force deny the civil rights to

1222
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,200
criminals for example

1223
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,599
it's not good okay so we allow them to

1224
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,599
okay if you allow the criminals to have

1225
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,280
civil rights go on and

1226
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
bring the country to the crisis this is

1227
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,440
a bloodless way to do

1228
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,760
curb the rights i mean not to put them

1229
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
in prison no no i'm not talking about

1230
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,200
putting all the gays from san francisco

1231
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,040
in the concentration camp

1232
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,079
do not allow them to take

1233
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,240
political force do not elect them to the

1234
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,800
seats of power whether it is

1235
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,079
municipality level

1236
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,359
state level or federal level it has to

1237
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:13,760
be

1238
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,880
bitten in the heads of american voters

1239
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,960
that the person like that in the city of

1240
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,160
power is an

1241
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,280
enemy do not be afraid of this word it

1242
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,319
is an animal if he is not an enemy here

1243
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,480
he will be here

1244
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,160
later on he will be shot of course

1245
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,680
but at this point he is an enemy

1246
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,559
okay you are doing great service by

1247
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,119
denying him a right

1248
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,200
to capitalize on his own crazy ideas and

1249
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,480
become

1250
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,839
a powerful man a man who uses

1251
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,760
the seat of power restriction of certain

1252
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
freedoms and permissiveness at that

1253
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,119
point

1254
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,200
would prevent sliding into crisis and

1255
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,880
probably will return the process of

1256
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,319
destabilization

1257
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,119
to curb unlimited power monopolistic

1258
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,480
power of trade unions

1259
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,200
here at that point would save economy

1260
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,200
from collapsing

1261
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,720
to introduce a law to stop

1262
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,000
private companies of raping public

1263
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,800
opinions

1264
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,599
mind income in the in the direction of

1265
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,760
consumerism

1266
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,200
no company must have a right

1267
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,000
to force you into buying more unless you

1268
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,400
want it

1269
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,520
there must be a law you want to

1270
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,960
advertise your your car

1271
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,400
okay but not a single mentioning of

1272
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,839
buying it now and saving money

1273
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,160
it must be against the law to force

1274
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,599
people to consume more

1275
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,359
self-restraint previously before this

1276
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,720
process started

1277
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,079
the self-restraint was the business of

1278
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,280
church religion because our preachers

1279
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,079
the fathers of church would tell us

1280
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,119
material values are good but it's not

1281
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,160
the prime

1282
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,640
function of human being because you have

1283
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,599
to live with

1284
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,240
something obviously the design for our

1285
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,720
life

1286
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,640
is not to consume more deodorant

1287
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,440
there must be something greater if such

1288
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,880
a complicated

1289
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,000
instrument this human body was created

1290
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,680
obviously there must be some higher

1291
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,319
purpose for that

1292
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,079
and it's very easy to avoid

1293
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,640
destabilization by denying

1294
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,319
the greedy companies one little freedom

1295
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,280
one little liberty forcing you into

1296
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,400
turning yourself

1297
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,079
into processors of unwanted products and

1298
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,000
goods

1299
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,040
they turn you into machines

1300
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,800
like a the worm who there's inlet and

1301
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,160
outlet so

1302
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,480
and how long an average appliance lasts

1303
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,920
these days

1304
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,000
less than a year why

1305
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,440
is workmanship we want you to buy more

1306
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,480
okay this stabilization process could be

1307
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,680
easily overcome

1308
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,200
if as i say the society

1309
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,599
by its own will or after persuasion by

1310
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,440
the leaders

1311
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,680
will come to the idea of self-restraint

1312
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,079
it's so hard we want to consume more but

1313
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,079
you have to

1314
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,720
unless you will come to this stage when

1315
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,200
as we say in russia if sahara desert

1316
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,040
ever becomes a communist state

1317
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,480
there will be shortage of sand

1318
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,420
so you have to curb your

1319
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,480
[Laughter]

1320
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,079
you have to you have to curb your

1321
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,200
expectations at this point

1322
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,359
before it's too late but no we don't

1323
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,119
want to do it

1324
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,000
demoralization process again it's the

1325
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,400
easiest thing to reverse

1326
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,680
first of all by restricting import of

1327
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,040
propaganda

1328
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,280
the easiest thing to do

1329
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,359
unlimited unrestrained import

1330
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,200
of soviet literature soviet journalists

1331
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,000
uh giving soviet propaganda and

1332
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,400
ideological agitators equal time on

1333
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,960
american tv network

1334
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,480
it has to be stopped and it's easy

1335
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,960
they won't they won't be offended minded

1336
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,720
as a matter of fact they will respect

1337
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,359
america

1338
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,720
more but then my former colleague

1339
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,280
vladimir posner appears on nightline

1340
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,720
and ted coffee will ask him well

1341
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,640
vladimir what do you think about this

1342
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:46,880
and

1343
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,599
what can he think he is an instrument of

1344
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,359
propaganda he thinks what what

1345
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,640
what comrade andropov tells him to think

1346
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,359
he is just a nice articulate mouthpiece

1347
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,480
of the soviet uh

1348
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,599
uh subversion system and telco makes you

1349
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,640
believe

1350
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,680
that my friend vladimir posner thinks

1351
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,359
[Laughter]

1352
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,160
the process of demoralization may not

1353
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,280
have started at

1354
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,880
all if at that point

1355
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,920
the country which is a recipient of

1356
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,200
subversion actively

1357
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,920
not violently but actively prevents

1358
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,280
importation of foreign ideology

1359
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,599
i don't want america to follow the

1360
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,440
pattern of ancient japan

1361
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
you don't have to shoot every foreigner

1362
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,880
when it approaches

1363
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,920
the sacred borders of the united states

1364
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,720
but when he

1365
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,280
offers you a junk in the disguise of

1366
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,599
very shiny something

1367
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,799
you have to tell him no we have our own

1368
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:59,839
junk

1369
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:06,319
if at that point the society is strong

1370
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,240
brave and conscientious enough

1371
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,799
to stop importation of ideas which are

1372
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,280
foreign

1373
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,880
then the whole chain of events could be

1374
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,799
prevented

1375
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,359
recently i've been to philippines and i

1376
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,520
was shocked

1377
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,720
how in big cities like manila children

1378
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,920
listen to deafening music

1379
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,680
a melodious nation with long traditions

1380
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,559
of

1381
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,160
good nice ethnic music introduced by

1382
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,880
spanish

1383
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,079
long time ago maybe two centuries three

1384
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,000
centuries ago i don't remember

1385
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,839
all of a sudden listen to musical

1386
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,920
garbage

1387
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,559
blasting their radios at full blast at

1388
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:53,359
the

1389
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,720
full volume why in

1390
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,160
india i spent many years watching the

1391
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,119
reactions of

1392
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,200
indians walking out of movie theaters

1393
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,640
after seeing hollywood production

1394
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,440
they they couldn't figure out why

1395
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,599
americans are so wasteful they smash

1396
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,559
their cars

1397
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,760
their shiny cars every five minutes how

1398
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,359
come they shoot each other for half

1399
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,760
million dollars

1400
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,680
is it true that they are so sex sex

1401
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,960
i mean obsessed with sex can you imagine

1402
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,240
showing a movie where each five minutes

1403
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,119
there is a

1404
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,599
copulation on the screen to a country

1405
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,680
like india with long traditions

1406
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,200
tradition of of respect to this private

1407
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,160
matters

1408
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,280
or to pakistan

1409
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,799
and united states expect these people to

1410
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,640
respect you

1411
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,359
no way oh yes they will see the movie

1412
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,880
they'll pay five rupees to see that

1413
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,520
garbage

1414
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,280
but they walk out and will tell their

1415
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,440
kids don't

1416
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,119
respect americans don't be like

1417
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,880
americans

1418
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,680
see so the process of demoralization

1419
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,960
could be stopped right here

1420
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,079
both as an expert and as an import

1421
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,119
and that takes one step

1422
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,760
one very important thing to do you don't

1423
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,640
have to expel

1424
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,319
all the kgb agents from washington dc

1425
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,480
the most difficult and at the same time

1426
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,400
the simplest answer

1427
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,520
to the subversion is to start it here

1428
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,480
and even before

1429
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,480
by bringing back the society to

1430
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,520
religion something that you cannot touch

1431
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,000
and eat and put on yourself but

1432
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,720
something that

1433
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,200
rules society and makes it move and

1434
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
preserve it

1435
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,799
a soviet scientist who has nothing to do

1436
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,000
with religion

1437
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,599
he is a computer scientist did a very

1438
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,200
intensive research

1439
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,240
on the history of socialist countries

1440
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,400
he called socialist or communist any

1441
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,839
country with the centralized

1442
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,720
economy and the pyramidal style of power

1443
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,559
structure

1444
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,200
and he discovered actually he didn't

1445
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,319
discover it he just

1446
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,960
brought to attention of his readers that

1447
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,240
civilizations like mohan jodaro

1448
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,079
in the river hindus area

1449
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,240
like egypt like maya incas

1450
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,799
like the below but the bologna culture

1451
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,799
collapsed and disappeared from the

1452
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,760
surface of earth the moment they lost

1453
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,520
religion

1454
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,079
as simple as that they disintegrated

1455
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,200
nobody remembers

1456
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,960
about them anymore well distantly

1457
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,880
so the ideas

1458
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,920
are moving society and keeping mankind

1459
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,640
as a society of human beings intelligent

1460
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,079
moral agents of god

1461
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,160
the facts the truth the exact knowledge

1462
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,599
may not all the sophisticated technology

1463
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,920
and computers will not prevent society

1464
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,319
from

1465
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:14,559
disintegrating and eventually dying out

1466
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,160
have you ever met a person who would

1467
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,599
sacrifice his

1468
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,880
life freedom for the truth like that

1469
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,559
this is truth i never met the person who

1470
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,480
said this is truth and i'm ready to

1471
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,880
shoot me

1472
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,520
to defend the truth right

1473
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,480
but millions sacrifice their life

1474
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,119
freedom

1475
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,640
comfort everything

1476
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,880
for things like god

1477
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,000
like jesus christ it's an honor

1478
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,440
some markers in in the soviet

1479
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,480
concentration camp died

1480
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,000
and they died in peace unlike those who

1481
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,760
shouted longleaf stalin

1482
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,160
knowing perfectly well that you may not

1483
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,720
live long

1484
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,839
something which is

1485
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,240
something which is not material

1486
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,880
moves society and helps it to survive

1487
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,960
and the other way around the moment we

1488
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,319
turn into two by two is four

1489
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,319
and make it a guiding principle of our

1490
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,119
life our existence

1491
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,640
we die even though this is true

1492
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,760
and this we cannot prove we only can

1493
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,240
feel

1494
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,200
and have faith in it so the answer to

1495
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,599
ideological subversion

1496
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,160
strangely enough is very simple you

1497
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,000
don't have to shoot people you don't

1498
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,680
have to aim missiles and

1499
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,920
pershings and cruise missiles at

1500
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,559
andropovs headquarters

1501
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,599
you simply have to have faith and

1502
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,680
prevent subversion

1503
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,720
in other words not to be a victim of

1504
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,240
subversion

1505
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,760
don't try to be a person who in judo

1506
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,480
is trying to smash your enemy and being

1507
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,440
caught by your hand

1508
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,960
don't strike like that strike with power

1509
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,480
you have spirit and moral superiority

1510
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,000
if you don't have the power it's high

1511
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,920
time to develop it

1512
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,200
and that's the only answer

1513
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:45,839
that's it thank you

1514
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,640
you
