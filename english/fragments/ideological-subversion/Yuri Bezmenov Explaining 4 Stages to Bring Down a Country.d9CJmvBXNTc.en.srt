1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
well you spoke several times before

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,740
about ideological subversion that is a

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,080
phrase that I'm afraid some Americans

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,440
don't fully understand when the Soviets

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,900
used the phrase ideological subversion

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,940
what do they mean by ideological

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,240
subversion is is the process

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,600
which is legitimate all word

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
and open you can see it with your own

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
eyes all you have to do all American

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,500
mass media has to do is to unplug their

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
bananas from their ears open up their

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,120
eyes and they can see it there's no

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,739
mystery there's nothing to do with

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,079
Espionage I know that Espionage

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,579
intelligence gathering looks more

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,040
romantic it sells more deodorants

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,320
through the advertising probably that's

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,660
why your Hollywood producers are so

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,620
crazy about James Bond type of Thrills

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,800
but in reality the main emphasis of the

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
KGB is not in the area of its

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,260
intelligence at all according to my

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,120
opinion and opinion of many of the

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,579
factors of my caliber only about 15

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,119
percent of time money and Manpower is

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,180
spent on Espionage as such the other 85

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,580
percent is a slow process

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,100
which we call either ideological

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,479
subversion or active measures active in

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,119
the language of the KGB or psychological

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,060
warfare what it basically means is to

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,820
change the perception of reality of

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,920
every American

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,560
to such an extent that despite of the

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,600
abundance of information

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
no one is able to come to sensible

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,439
conclusions

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,020
in the interests of Defending themselves

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,299
their families their community and their

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,560
country

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,520
it's a great brainwashing process which

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,460
goes very slow and it's divided in four

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,740
basic stages

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,740
the first one being demoralization it

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,079
takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
a nation why that many years because

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,000
this is the minimum number of years

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,180
which requires to educate one generation

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,680
of students

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,700
in the country of of your enemy exposed

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,640
to the ideology of the enemy in other

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,459
words Marxism leninism ideology is being

54
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,680
pumped into the soft heads of of at

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,000
least three generations of American

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,340
students without being challenged or

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,099
counterbalanced by the basic values of

58
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,860
americanism American patriotism the

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,620
result the result you can see most of

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,040
the people who graduated in 60s

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,200
dropouts or half-baked intellectuals are

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,360
now occupying the positions of power in

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,220
the government civil service business

64
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,400
mass media educational system you are

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,379
stuck with them you cannot get rid of

66
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,599
them they are contaminated they are

67
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,760
programmed to think and react to certain

68
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,160
stimuli in a certain pattern

69
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,500
you cannot change their mind even if you

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,080
if you expose them to authentic

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,300
information even if you prove that white

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,819
is white and black is black you still

73
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,700
cannot change the basic perception and

74
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,620
the logic of behavior

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,540
in other words these people

76
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,780
uh the process of demoralization is

77
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,480
complete and irreversible to get rid

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,220
Society of these people you have you

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,239
need another 20 or or 15 years to

80
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,980
educate a new generation of

81
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,220
patriotically minded and and common

82
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,060
common sense people who would be acting

83
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,140
in favor and in the interests of the of

84
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,959
the United States society and yet these

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,700
people have been programmed and as you

86
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,819
say in place and who are favorable to an

87
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,099
opening with the Soviet concept these

88
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,599
are the very people who would be marked

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,459
for extermination in this country most

90
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,580
of them yes uh simply because the

91
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,220
psychological shock when when they will

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,500
see in future what the what the

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,720
beautiful Society of equality and social

94
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,900
justice means in practice obviously they

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,140
will Revolt they they will they will be

96
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,140
very unhappy frustrated people and

97
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,900
Marxist leninistration does not tolerate

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,099
these people

99
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,500
uh they obviously they will join the

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,940
links of the centers dissidents

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,858
unlike in present United States there

102
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,019
will be no place for descent in future

103
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,060
Marxist Lenin is America

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,199
uh here you can you can get uh popular

105
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,020
like Daniel Ellsberg and Filthy Rich

106
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
like Jane Fonda for being dissident for

107
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,880
criticizing your Pentagon in Future

108
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,000
these people will be simply

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,620
squashed like cockroaches nobody is

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,180
going to pay them nothing for their

111
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,360
beautiful Noble ideas of equality this

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
they don't understand and it will be

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,620
greatest shock for them of course

114
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,259
the demoralization process in the United

115
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,020
States is basically completed already

116
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,860
for the last 25 years actually it's over

117
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,259
fulfilled because demoralization now

118
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,199
reaches such areas where previously not

119
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,300
even comrade and drop off and and all

120
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,419
his experts would would even dream of

121
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,600
such a tremendous success most of it is

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,419
done by Americans to Americans thanks to

123
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,520
lack of moral standards as I mentioned

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,300
before

125
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,900
uh exposure to True information does not

126
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,520
matter anymore

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,240
a person who was demoralized is unable

128
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,699
to assess true information the facts

129
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,840
tell nothing to him even if I shower him

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,820
with information with the authentic

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,580
proof with documents with pictures

132
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,979
even if I take him by force to the

133
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,840
Soviet Union and show him concentration

134
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,199
camp he will refuse to believe it until

135
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,080
he he is going to receive a cake in the

136
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,840
in his fat bottom when a military boat

137
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,060
crashes his balls then he will

138
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,039
understand but not before that that's

139
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,479
the tragic of the situation of

140
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,419
demoralization so basically America is

141
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,300
stuck with demoralization and unless

142
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,000
even if if you start right now here this

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,500
minute you start educating new

144
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,300
generation of Americans it will still

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,539
take you 15 to 20 years to turn the tide

146
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,160
of of ideological perception of reality

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
uh back to normal normalcy and and

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,539
patriotism

149
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,840
the next stage is destabilization this

150
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,660
time subverter does not care about your

151
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,220
ideas and the patterns of your

152
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,080
consumption whether you eat junk food

153
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,000
and get fat and flub it doesn't matter

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,819
anymore this time and it takes only from

155
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,800
two to five years to destabilize the

156
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,100
nation uh it's what what matters is

157
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,800
Essentials economy Foreign Relations

158
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,199
defense systems

159
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,199
and you can see it quite clearly that in

160
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,940
some areas in such sensitive areas is

161
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,780
defense and economy the influence of

162
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,520
marxist leninist ideas in the United

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,580
States is absolutely fantastic I could

164
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,440
never believe it 14 years ago when I

165
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,020
landed in this part of the world that

166
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,960
the process will go that fast

167
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,360
uh the next stage of course is Crisis it

168
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,180
it may take only up to six weeks to to

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,160
bring a country to the verge of Crisis

170
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,280
you can see it in in Central America now

171
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,860
after crisis with a violent change of

172
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,740
power structure and economy you have

173
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,560
so-called the period of normalization it

174
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,319
may last indefinitely normalization is a

175
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,479
cynical expression borrowed from Soviet

176
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,639
propaganda when the Soviet tanks moved

177
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,160
into Czechoslovakia in 68 comrade

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,680
breshev said now the situation in

179
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,259
brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized

180
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,180
this is what will happen in the United

181
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,280
States if you allow all these Schmucks

182
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,740
to bring the country to crisis

183
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,259
to promise people all kind of goodies

184
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,259
and the paradise on Earth to to

185
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,560
destabilize your economy to eliminate

186
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,539
the principle of free market competition

187
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,900
and to put a big broader government

188
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,680
in Washington DC with the benevolent

189
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
dictators Like Walter Mondale who will

190

promise lots of things never mind this

191
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:14,819
is what will happen in the United States

192
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,979
if you allow all these Schmucks to bring

193
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,080
the country to crisis

194
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,599
to promise people all kind of goodies

195
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,599
and the paradise on Earth to to

196
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,900
destabilize your economy to eliminate

197
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,879
the principle of free market competition

198
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,179
and to put a big brother government

199
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,019
in Washington DC with the benevolent

200
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,958
dictators Like Walter Mondale who will

201
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,000
promise lots of things never mind

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,919
whether the promises are fulfillable or

203
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,260

204
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,779
bottoms of new generation of Soviet

assassins never mind he will create

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
false illusions that the situation is

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,700
under control situation is not under

208
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,459
control situation is disgustingly out of

209
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,160
control most of the American politicians

210
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,880
media and educational system

211
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,800
trains another generation of people who

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,980
think they are living at a peace time

213
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,920
false the United States is in the state

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,820
of War Undeclared total war against the

215
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,760
basic principles and the foundations of

216
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
this system

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,320
and and the initiator of this war is not

218
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,980
covered on drop of of course

219
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,839
it's it's the system

220
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,240
however ridiculous it may sound the

221
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,459
world communist system or the world

222
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,500
communist conspiracy whether it's care

223
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,620
some people or not I don't give a hood

224
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,200
if you are not scared by now nothing can

225
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,519
scare you

226
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,740
but you don't have to be paranoid about

227
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,980
it what what actually happens now

228
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,160
that unlike myself you have

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,160
literally several years to live on

230
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,980
unless United States wake up the the

231
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,800
time bomb is ticking with every second

232
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,260
the disaster is coming closer and closer

233
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,140
unlike myself you will have nowhere to

234
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,820
defect to

235
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,740
unless you want to live in Antarctica

236
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,140

237
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,300
last country of freedom and and

238
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,180
possibility okay so what do we do what

239
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,680
is your recommendation to the American

240
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,420
people well uh the uh the immediate

241
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,339
thing that comes to my mind is of course

242
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,940
there must be a very strong National

243
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,839
effort to educate people in in in the

244
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
spirit of real Patriots is number one

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,700
number two to to explain them the real

246
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,980
danger of Socialist Communist whatever

247
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,160
welfare state Big Brother government

248
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
if people will fail to grasp the

249
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,579
impending danger of that development

250
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,440
