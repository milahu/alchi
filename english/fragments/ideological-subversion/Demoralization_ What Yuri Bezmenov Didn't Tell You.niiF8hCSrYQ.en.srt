1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
i'm sure most people watching this are

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
aware of the former kgb

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,600
agent turned cia informant yuri besmanov

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,760
in the 1980s besmanoff went around the

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,639
usa

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,880
speaking mostly to conservative groups

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
about how the usa had been infiltrated

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,160
with communist

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
agents sent from moscow when many people

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,800
started to pay attention to what was

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,960
going on in politics on youtube

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,119
a few years back many of his interviews

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,720
and lectures went viral

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,720
and for a lot of people this was one of

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,199
their first steps to having their eyes

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,160
opened he describes a four-stage process

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,719
of demoralization

18
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,520
destabilization crisis and normalization

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,079
a deliberate soviet attempt at

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
infiltration and subversion

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
now many aspects of this story are true

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
but i'm afraid that there are some

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,559
detailed old yuri

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,039
left out and besides you've got to ask

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,760
yourself

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
how is it that you've heard of this guy

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
how is it that millions of people have

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,000
watched

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
yuri besmanov videos here on youtube why

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
is it as i pointed out a couple of

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,879
months ago

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,600
that yuri has been mainstreamed well i'm

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
going to answer some of those questions

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
shortly but first let's take a quick

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,280
break

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,119

he's now offering foundations of

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
economics

42

and level up your econ knowledge

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
okay so what's wrong with the story yui

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439
besmanoff tells

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,720
i will explain but before i do so let me

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,400
note that in this video i'm going to be

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,759
using very mainstream

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,920
sources by which i mean left-wing

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,439
journals and wikipedia

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,600
entries in order to show that there is

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,720
no aspect of

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,159
what i'm telling you that could be

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,240
described as conspiracy theory

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,960
this is all completely open information

55
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
freely available to anyone with access

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
to google okay with that noted the

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,280
problem with

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
yuri's narrative is that the ultimate

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
source of the demoralization

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,479
program he describes was not moscow

61
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,040
but frankfurt and specifically the

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,479
frankfurt school

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
which i am sure you have heard of it

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
included a group of radical thinkers

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
including theodore adorno

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
max horkheimer eric fromm and herbert

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
marcouza

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
the institute for social research at

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
goethe university in frankfurt

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
was set up in 1923 by the marxist

71
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,640
carl grumberg it was bankrolled by the

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,400
son of a german millionaire

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
grain merchant importantly though

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
this was an alternative branch of

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,280
marxism

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
which was against the soviet project

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,040
and sought to analyze its problems which

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
is to say that it was entirely

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
independent

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
of moscow max horkheimer took over as

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,239
director

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
of the institute in 1930 and then

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
recruited adorno

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,319
from and later marcus among others

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,920
after the rise of hitler in 1933

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
horkheimer moved the institute from

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
frankfurt to geneva

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
eric fromm went on a trip to the united

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
states around this time

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,959
where he persuaded columbia university

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,159
based in new york

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
to grant the institute for social

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
research refuge

94
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,720
while germany was under nazi rule and so

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,840
the frankfurt school

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
new home from 1935 was new york city

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,319
while there the frankfurt school devoted

98
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,319
much thought to what had gone wrong in

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,120
germany

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
from their perspective and located the

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,239
problem

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,480
in both the german mindset which is to

103
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,200
say the psychology of the german people

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
and in german culture which is to say

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,319
the cultural modes which perpetuate

106
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,080
this psychology anti-semitism

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,720
for example was diagnosed as a pathology

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,360
a symptom

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
of the authoritarian personality type

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,120
hawkheimer

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
made a number of strategic alliances in

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,400
new york

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,280
most importantly he allied the frankfurt

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,920
school

115
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,720
with the american jewish committee a

116
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
non-profit

117
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
jewish advocacy group which is

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,760
headquartered in new york

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,120
which had some but not total influence

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
in washington

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
the frankfurt school proposed some very

122
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
radical solutions to the problem of

123
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
fascism in europe

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,680
as early as 1941 horkheimer had drawn up

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
plans for nothing less than the total

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
re-education of the german people

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
the aims of which were quote the mental

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,080
transformation

129
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,400
of the german human being culture and

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
society

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
towards democracy morality which

132
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,520
respects human dignity

133
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
and the world in 1942

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
herbert marcuser started working

135
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
directly for the office of strategic

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
services which was the predecessor

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,000
organization of the cia

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
now i should be clear here this is not

139
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
to suggest that the frankfurt school

140
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
or marcusa were directly in charge of

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,400
running u.s government policy

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
or anything like it a country like the

143
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,919
usa is big

144
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,240
and complex the government is not a

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,039
monolith

146
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
it has different networks and different

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,400
nodes of power

148
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
for example for almost the entirety of

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
his time working for the government

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
marcusa was under surveillance by the

151
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
fbi

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
and the suspicion of being a communist

153
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,759
infiltrator

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,720
and in fact this dynamic of these

155
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,840
frankfurt school

156
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,639
thinkers operating in the u.s government

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,919
at the same time

158
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,000
that the red scare was going on is a

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
source of much confusion

160
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,919
but all of this should be made much

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
clearer in your own mind

162
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
if you see the frankfurt school thinkers

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
as the new left

164
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
entirely independent of and even against

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,720
moscow and the soviet union who are the

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
old left

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,440
as marcusa and others such as franz

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,880
newman and otto kirkheimer

169
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
joined the office of strategic services

170
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
in washington dc

171
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,919
horkheimer and adorno relocated to

172
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,280
california

173
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
hawkheimer had been appointed as

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,199
director of the scientific division

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,440
of the american jewish committee and it

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
was in this capacity he started his

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
five studies in prejudice and the

178
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
aforementioned research

179
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
into the authoritarian personality type

180
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,960
when

181
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,160
the second world war ended the allied

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,440
powers embarked on a program called

183
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,680
denazification a vast propaganda effort

184
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,280
essentially to convert the german

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,840
population from supporting nazism

186
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
to supporting liberal democracy in the

187
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,039
case of

188
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
west germany and to supporting socialism

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
or communism

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
in the case of east germany the

191
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
administration

192
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
for this program was divided into four

193
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,639
zones

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
one under the americans one under the

195
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
british

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
one under the soviets and one under the

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
french

198
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
this is significant because we can see

199
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
side by side

200
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
how the de-nazification effort as

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,639
directed by washington

202
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,520
and moscow respectively were applied

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,919
note

204
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
that hawkheimer's plan to completely

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,479
re-educate and remold the german mindset

206
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,280
from the ground

207
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
up or i should say from the top down was

208
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,560
here

209
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
effectively adopted as the official

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
policy

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,479
of the us federal government in order to

212
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,560
achieve their aims general eisenhower

213
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
set up the institute on re-education

214
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,319
of the axis countries stating only an

215
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,680
inflexible long-term

216
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,000
occupation authority will be able to

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
lead the germans to a fundamental

218
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,479
revision

219
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
of their recent political philosophy

220
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,319
this was under the auspices of the

221
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,000
psychological warfare division

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,319
of the supreme headquarters allied

223
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,840
expeditionary force

224
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
now if the phrase psychological warfare

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,520
sounds familiar to you

226
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
perhaps it is because our old friend

227
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,560
yuri besmanov

228
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,639
uses it to describe the four-stage

229
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,840
process of demoralization and subversion

230
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
now in practice the americans faced two

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
quite separate problems here

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
the first was the very practical problem

233
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
that if they arrested

234
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,879
anyone who would work for the nazi party

235
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
or the german government in any capacity

236
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
at all

237
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,879
it would result in having to process

238
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,960
over 35 million people

239
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
the second was the more intangible issue

240
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,240
of the

241
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
everyday thoughts and beliefs of the

242
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
german people the logistical nightmare

243
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
of the first problem

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
led the us army to declare that most

245
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,639
german people had simply been

246
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
brainwashed by nazi propaganda

247
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
so efforts were intensified on the

248
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
second problem

249
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,159
the us army seized 37 german newspapers

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,479
six radio stations 314 theaters

251
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,559
642 cinemas 101 magazines

252
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,720
237 book publishers and 7

253
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
384 book dealers and printers over 30

254
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
000 books were banned all copies of

255
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
these books were confiscated and

256
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,279
destroyed

257
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
the representative of the military

258
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
directorate admitted that

259
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
the order was in principle no different

260
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,560
from the nazi

261
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,040
book burnings remember always accuse

262
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,839
your enemy

263
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,240
of that which you are guilty yourself

264
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
now although

265
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
in the short term only high-ranking

266
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
nazis were individually

267
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
punished and most germans were not

268
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,839
under the logic that they had been

269
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
brainwashed

270
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
in the longer term the official policy

271
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
of the american

272
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,959
denacification program was to get

273
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,240
germans to accept

274
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
collective responsibility for what had

275
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,600
happened

276
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
including posters which showed

277
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
atrocities and said things like

278
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
this is your fault and these atrocities

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
your fault and this is chiefly where the

280
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
frankfurt schools work on fascism being

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
some sort of

282
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,680
inborn psychological trait of the german

283
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
mindset

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
started to take root as official policy

285
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,720
in fascism the career of a concept

286
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
paul gottfried chronicles how the

287
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
definition of fascism

288
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
or the authoritarian personality type

289
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
expanded

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
far beyond the specific atrocities of

291
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,000
the nazis

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
and came to be seen as something endemic

293
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
in german culture

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
and history as a whole even going so far

295
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,079
as to implicate

296
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,360
christianity itself sydney bernstein

297
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
the chief of the psychological warfare

298
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,920
division in 1946

299
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,519
said the aim of this program was to

300
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
shake and humiliate the germans and

301
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,279
prove to them

302
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,760
beyond any possible challenge that these

303
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
german crimes against humanity

304
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
were committed and that the german

305
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,480
people and not just the nazis and the ss

306
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
bore responsibility in fact america

307
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,399
forced germany

308
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,760
through all four stages of the

309
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,720
process that yuri besmonoff describes

310
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,200
and

311
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
by the 1970s had been largely successful

312
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
certainly if you look at germany today

313
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
you can see just how successful

314
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,600
they were i think it's notable that most

315
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,320
of the

316
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
support for the afd for example which is

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
the far-right group

318
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
one so-called far-right group in germany

319
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
is in east germany

320
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
not in west germany in contrast the

321
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
soviets in their denuncification efforts

322
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,720
did

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,959
practically none of this they were much

324
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,079
more brutal

325
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
and much less sophisticated in their

326
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
methods simply sending

327
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
former nazis to the gulag and their

328
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
propaganda efforts

329
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,079
were focused much more squarely on

330
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
getting germans to accept socialism

331
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,279
and remove anti-socialist sentiment

332
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
rather than to renounce

333
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
their entire history and culture

334
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,640
and accept responsibility collectively

335
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
for nazi atrocities

336
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
you can see how different the approach

337
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,079
was from the american

338
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,800
effort just from these few details now

339
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,920
at the top level

340
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,839
successive american governments came to

341
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,959
lose interest

342
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,680
in the denunciation program as they

343
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,399
became

344
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,160
more embroiled in the cold war in 1949

345
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
horkheimer and adorno returned to

346
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
frankfurt and reestablished the

347
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,279
institute of social research around this

348
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,839
time

349
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,160
the us formally handed over control of

350
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
the process to the germans who

351
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
would now be responsible for their own

352
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,680
re-education

353
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,000
now it strikes me that since this time

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
since

355
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,320
1949 1950 the institutions

356
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,560
and processes that were set up in the

357
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,079
direct aftermath

358
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
of world war ii continued largely

359
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,680
unchecked

360
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
the definition of fascism didn't stop

361
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,519
with the german people

362
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
or with german culture over time it

363
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,680
expanded to include

364
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
european culture as a whole british

365
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,959
culture

366
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
and indeed american culture no one

367
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,959
person

368
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,360
needed to be in charge of this it worked

369
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,079
almost

370
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
by itself as frankfurt school

371
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
type thought came to dominate western

372
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
universities

373
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
in the 1960s and onwards not

374
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
as the result of infiltration from

375
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,200
moscow

376
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
but as a form of continuation from

377
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,240
systems

378
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
institutions and programs that have been

379
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
set up by the frankfurt

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
school and their allies in the 1940s

381
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
if the original sin of the germans was

382
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
to be the holocaust

383
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
each other country would find its own

384
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
original sin

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
in britain it was the empire and

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
colonialism

387
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
in america it was slavery and racism now

388
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
in 2020

389
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
all of these things have coalesced into

390
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,560
one unifying concept called

391
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,360
whiteness and for the re-education

392
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519

of course the symbols of these things

394
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160

398
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,639

399
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,199
include

400
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
more and more things under the

401
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
definition of fascism

402
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,360
