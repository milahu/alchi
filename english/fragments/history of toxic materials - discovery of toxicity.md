these materials all were considered "safe", and you were called "crazy" when you tried to warn people, before the actual damages grew too large to cover them up, so today we have a "scientific consent" that these materials are harmful

for "secretly harmful" materials like electromagnetic radiation, the "proof of harm" is much harder to show

and the idiots will always "if it was harmful, it would be prohibited by our benevolent dictators"
