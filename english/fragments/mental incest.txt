mental incest



You know what's killing the world?
Not war, not pollution, not bad coffee.
It's mental incest —
everyone screwing their own minds
inside a tiny little echo chamber and calling it "truth".

Physical incest gives you three-eyed kids.
Mental incest gives you three-eyed ideologies —
half-blind, half-crazy, and absolutely convinced they're perfect.
Same DNA over and over again, no fresh input,
just a bunch of copy-paste thoughts breeding in the dark.

A few suits at the top decide what counts as "reasonable".
Their subjective worldview —
their fears, their comfort zones,
their reptile-brain survival rules, their fear of death —
get dressed up as "objective standards".
Then they shove that down everybody's throat
with laws, algorithms, and smiley-face PR.
They call it "order".
It's really a personality cage with good lighting.

They talk about equality of outcome — the great holy grail of mediocrity.
Nobody higher, nobody deeper, nobody different.
Everyone gets the same gray mind so nobody feels left out.
That's not fairness; that's lobotomy with a slogan.

We used to have a solution space — remember that?
Big, messy, full of weird ideas.
Now we've got a shoebox.
And they guard that shoebox like it's the Ark of the Covenant.
You step outside it, you're a heretic,
a conspiracy theorist, or just "not a team player".

It's the Overton Window turned into an Overton Jail Cell.
And the guards?
They don't even need guns.
Everyone polices themselves.
Smile, agree, repeat.
That's mental incest — breeding safety, birthing stupidity.

And the best part?
They think it's moral.
They think their fear of difference is compassion.
But it's just the lizard part of the brain running the show,
the "don't move or you'll die" instinct.
And when the cortex — the part that imagines, questions, laughs — tries to speak up,
the herd hisses, "Shut up! You're making us uncomfortable!"

So here we are: a planet of comfortable slaves in designer cages,
worshipping sameness and calling it progress.
And the real rebels?
They're the ones still trying to think with unapproved neurons.



the mental incest in that company was disgusting.
probably they never heard of the concept of personality types.
