  He was all about that trolling.
  If it were true that McAffee had a stash of data he wanted us to trust after he died,
  he would publish it in the open, encrypted, so that we know it is the data he is talking about,
  and then just release the key after his death.
  There's no reason to hide the data itself until after he died, or to permanently hide the decryption key.

  he killed his abusive father and made it look like a suicide
  he killed his neighbor and made it look like "the CIA did this to jail me"
  he never released his dead man switch with 31 TB evidence of corruption in the government of belize
  he says that he is a nihilist ("i dont care")
  he faked a heart attack to get from prison to hospital in guatemala
  he was always surrounded by idiots, for example the stupid "vice" reporter castoro (rocco?),
  who published a photo with GPS tag while mcafee was on the run at 00:23:52
  manipulative, liar, actor, "narciss", ...
  alcoholic (type 4), druggie (MDPV, hallucinogens, stimulants), ...
  i only find it fascinating that he accumulated billions of dollars, also by selling his company

  he kind-of hates the "vice" reporters... but he needs them to tell his story

  You're not as funny as you were.
  I may dump you here on the road if you don't get funnier.

  People say I remind them of the Joker.
  Possibly the Joker is, the best description of me.
  Who was the Joker?
  I mean, the motherfucker didn't give a shit, did he?
  Do you think I give a shit? No, people, I do not.
  So fucking be it. Haha haha haha.

  So he had the idea that there was a whole conspiracy against him.
  The cartel was after John, according to John.

  If I am one-tenth of what they find,
  a man who murders his neighbours, assassinates, uh, officials of foreign countries.
  If I am half that man, am I the man you wanna fuck with?

  01:36:16
  He once told me,
  "I can have anyone, anywhere killed, Alex. It's as easy as picking up the phone."
  You know what? I believed him. I really did. He just had that pull with people.
  He was the most brilliant, manipulative person that I've ever met.
  And he wanted to control narratives too. He did it expertly.

  00:51:58
  Special request. Uh, in this movie, can you, um...
  I know I'm talking about, like, the cartel
  and I'm talking about the Clintons and, like, whatever whatever.
  Can you just like make it so that I'm not authoritatively stating this to be factual maybe
  and just so that I don't get, like, offed?
  One thing I know, is that you don't fuck with the cartel.
