loose translation



traditional alchemy:
fire + air = masculine
earth + water = feminine

we change this to
fire + water = masculine
earth + air = feminine
and
fire + air = young
earth + water = old

cos fire and water have long bottom (and longer penis), which is more masculine.
cos earth and air have broad bottom ("child-bearing hips"), which is more feminine.

cos fire and air have broad top (and short hair), which is more childish.
cos earth and water have long top (and long hair), which is more mature.




the eigencolors of fire and air have two variants:
a. fire red + air yellow
b. fire yellow + air red

here we choose variant a (fire red + air yellow),
cos fire is opposite of earth (green) and red is opposite of green.
cos air is opposite of water (blue) and yellow is opposite of blue.
see the tenscross, or the four color system color wheel.
opposite colors do not mix.
depending on the color system (additive or subtractive), they mix to black or white.
