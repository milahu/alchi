The Jew cries out in pain as he strikes you

It's an antisemitic proverb that's basically saying that when Jews complain, the complaining is invalid because it's really the nonJews (goyim, goy) who are suffering.

The Jewish Bolsheviks (93% of all soviet commissars were Jewish, including Stalin, Lenin, and Trotsky) murdered 66 million Russians and it was a saying that Russian peasants used to say when complaining about the Jewish commissars calling them 'anti-semites' and 'racists' (the Jews invented this word) while murdering entire villages. This term entered the English vernacular through the stories of refugees from the Bolshevik 'Red terror'.

The origin of the term, however, has it's roots in 16th century Poland. The Jews were notorious as loan-sharks who used usury to enslave the polish peasantry through debt and they would use some of the most vile and cruel methods when collecting these debts, and would always complain that they were in fact the victims, even after employing murder, rape, and robbery to collect what they mistakenly believed they were owed. Hence the saying 'the Jew cries out in pain as he stikes you'.
