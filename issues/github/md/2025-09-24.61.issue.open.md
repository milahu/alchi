"Shared Ownership" -- yes, the actual problems are social problems.

instead of balanced teams, many projects are ruled by petty tyrants (or
unbalanced teams) who abuse their power for their selfish needs (not for
all users), and so useful progress (for all users) is blocked "because i
dont need it" (because a "vocal minority" drags everyone else down).

so how to create balanced teams? all successful organizations have long
solved this problem: they sort their workers by personality type
([alchi-types](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/alchi-types/alchi-types.html))
([alchi-test](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/alchi-test/)), and then
somehow connect different personality types into balanced teams,
balanced by personality type.

since there are four base personality types, every balanced team needs
exactly four people.

how to apply this to open source projects? every project needs four
maintainers. (or a multiple of four.)

where do we find maintainers? we all have some network of friends. we
should use this network to recruit the "missing puzzle pieces" for our
projects. "hey, youre a type 1, our project needs a type 1, can you
help?"

these "teams of four" should be stable, so communications are efficient,
and stress-tolerance is high.

every "team of four" maintains multiple projects. all team members get
notified of all changes in all projects.

people should be open about their personality type, and projects should
be open about the personality types of their staff, so projects can
easier recruit new workers, and workers can easier find new projects.

in an atomized culture, people contribute only to projects they actually
need, but in the "teams of four" culture, people contribute to all
projects maintained by their team, which includes projects they
otherwise would not contribute to, and in exchange, other team members
contribute back.

different people have different activity levels. to balance this, active
people can join more teams, and less-active people can join less teams.

> somehow connect different personality types

this is the main focus of my [alchi](https://github.com/milahu/alchi)
project. my proposed solution is the pallas pattern
([alchi.pallas-pattern.svg](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/images/alchi.pallas-pattern.svg))
([alchi-maps](https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/alchi-maps/public/alchi-maps.html#A1_(gea)_s+m_1100_0_en_np)).
but that is an implementation detail, and i expect that each "team of
four" will find its own ways to communicate. maybe my pallas-pattern is
wrong, maybe there are better solutions

  - Gatekeeping → controlling who gets in and which ideas are allowed,
    usually framed as “protecting quality” but often just a power
    reflex.
  - most people are not aware of the actual reasons (incompatible
    personality types), so they throw around some high-level "reasons"
    to appear "rational", while the actual forces at play are low-level
    instincts (gut feelings, subconscious, emotions, hormones, ...)
  - most people misattribute the source of conflict. They say things
    like “I disagree with your API design because…” but underneath it’s:
    dominance struggle, personality mismatch, clashing instinctual
    needs. So the “rational reasons” are mostly post-hoc justifications.
    This is very consistent with cognitive psychology: humans often
    generate reasons after the fact to cover instinct-driven decisions.
  - Maintainer–contributor conflicts are a modern form of sublimated
    ritual combat, where instinctual drives and personality
    incompatibilities disguise themselves as rational debates about
    software.
  - the actual conflict is personal, not rational ("people focus" versus
    "task focus")
- [2025-09-21.ChatGPT-Ego-and-culture-dynamics.md](https://github.com/milahu/alchi-journal/blob/main/doc/chat/2025-09-21.ChatGPT-Ego-and-culture-dynamics.md#prompt-1)
  - any atomized culture is doomed to fail, because humans are social
    animals by nature. so the actual problems are that too many people
    are alone in this world, when they should be in some group.
  - all groups should have a balance of smart and stupid people. so when
    a stupid member of group A is irrationaly (wrongly) attacking a
    smart member of group B, then smart members of group A can step in
    to "pull back" to false aggressor from group A (like a dog owner
    would pull back a stupid dog trying to attack someone), and then the
    conflict can be settled in a "civilized" manner, because smart and
    smart people meet on eye level, so they can debate the actual issue,
    without all the unnecessary drama caused by stupid people
- [hate-maintainers-censored](https://github.com/milahu/hate-maintainers-censored) -
  some of my experiences with bad maintainers
  - of course "bad" is very subjective, and all humans are selfish, so
    we all think "of course i am right and he is wrong", which can work
    in an atomized culture, where everyone thinks "i am smart" and "i am
    a winner", because these self-images are never challenged, there are
    no real comparisons... but for a team to work, there must be clear
    boundaries between "this is my strength" and "this is your strength"
- [Tragedy of the
  commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)
  - The tragedy of the commons is the concept that, if many people enjoy
    unfettered access to a finite, valuable resource, such as a pasture,
    they will tend to overuse it and may end up destroying its value
    altogether.
  - The principal concern of Hardin's essay was overpopulation of the
    planet. To prevent the inevitable tragedy (he argued) it was
    necessary to reject the principle (supposedly enshrined in the
    Universal Declaration of Human Rights) according to which every
    family has a right to choose the number of its offspring, and to
    replace it by "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon".
- [The Dark Side of Open Source: When Maintainers Burn
  Out](https://devtechinsights.com/open-source-maintainer-burnout/)
  - 4\. Decentralize Ownership
    - Avoid “bus factor = 1”—require multiple admins for critical
      projects.
    - Linux survives because thousands contribute.
- [And this is why I hate Open Source
  Sometimes...](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1774lmq/and_this_is_why_i_hate_open_source_sometimes/)
  - in the majority of cases, the bug reports are swiftly dismissed and
    closed by certain maintainers. Their comments range from "Not a bug,
    just a UX problem" to "Please file a ticket in system XY first
    before reporting here" and even "Sorry, but no fix." It's baffling.
    When I inquire further and seek clarification, most maintainers—when
    they choose to respond—become defensive and, in some instances,
    impolite. It's frustrating.
  - Is your tone inadvertently sounding rude?
