> when an English version of this book would be ready

the honest answer is "probably never"  
because this is a one-man-project  
and honetly, im bored to death even thinking about my project ^^  
i guess that "burnout" is the downside of my curious personality type
...

i have 2 old versions which i wrote manually in english  
<https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/alchi-book/build/>  
<https://milahu.github.io/alchi/src/whoaremyfriends/whoaremyfriends.html>

please feel free to add your annotations  
for example with <https://hypothes.is/>  
or email or pen-and-paper or ...

the good news is that my actual "core concept" is really simple:  
i propse this pattern of relationships ("pallas-pattern")

interactive version:

... when two people are close, the are compatible  
when two people are distant, they are "enemies"  
and need common friends as translators/moderators

i propse that "groups of four" work by a  
constant "peer exchange" (switching of bonding-partners)  
which correlates to a constant switching of subtypes (introverted vs
extroverted)  
and in effect, this creates a feedback-loop

the groups-of-four are needed because i assume:  
two people can have dialog only when both have the same basetype  
otherwise, they can have only monolog (one is always talking).  
to solve this "monolog problem"  
i connect four monologs, so they talk in a loop/circle

what makes my hypothesis seem complex  
is the conflict between my idealism  
and the conservatism/realism/fear of "the establishment" and "the real
world"

so my hypothesis has radical implications like "all human laws are
wrong,  
because they protect some types and destroy other types"  
or "kids are smarter than parents/teachers" etc  
... which is one possible reason  
why "we humans" have not solved this trivial problem ("who are my
friends?")  
or why this solution is guarded as corporate secret  
(governors fear their peasants, so they sabotage any
self-organization,  
just like they sabotage worker-unions or direct democracy)

more noise comes from my goal to reach laymen and children  
so i have to explain basics like the scientific method, etc

even more noise comes from my "doomsday expectation":  
if the internet would die tomorrow, what would you print today?  
so i added lots of my favorite quotes, and some memes

the reason why ive been focussing on the german version  
is because im printing and sending snail-mail letters to random
addresses in germany  
because "online is dead" (censorship, shadowbanning, spamfilters, ...)  
and as a "proof of work" (every printed book costs me 0,50 eur)  
and because i expect a powergrid-collapse in the near future

> i guess that "burnout" is the downside of my curious personality type

i also blame my personality type for my chaotic writing style:  
i produce mostly random associations  
and i find it very hard to produce "linear" stories
