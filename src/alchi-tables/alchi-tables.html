  who is my self? and who are my friends?<br>
</p>

<p>
  i am looking for my self and my friends<br>
  and this is my plan ....
</p>

<p>
  we can put all humans into one of sixteen boxes.<br>
  these sixteen boxes are:
</p>



<table class="fourxfour">
  <tr>
    <td width="25%">B1</td>
    <td width="25%">C2</td>
    <td width="25%">B3</td>
    <td width="25%">C4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D2</td>
    <td>A1</td>
    <td>D4</td>
    <td>A3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B4</td>
    <td>C3</td>
    <td>B2</td>
    <td>C1</td>

<p>
  yes, this is different from the sixteen types of MBTI,<br>
  cos MBTI is blind for age and gender.
</p>

<p>
  a letter shows the two "outer values" of age and gender.<br>
  age = S or L = young or old.<br>
  gender = F or M = female or male.
</p>

<p>
  we propose an exact definition of "nature and nurture". nature translates to body type = element. nurture translates to the six friends of each body, and the three different bond types [three modalities] between one body and its six friends.
</p>

<p>
  collisions of namespaces: different authors can have different definitions for the same words.
  for example the contrast between "abstract" and "concrete",
  where we have different definitions from a. carl jung (four cognitive functions, 34 abstract + 12 concrete),
  and b. david kolb (four learning styles, 14 abstract + 23 concrete).
  or take the contrast "extravert" and "introvert",
  where we have different definitions from a. myers-briggs (mbti: 23 extravert + 14 introvert)
  and b. hans eysenck (13 extravert + 24 introvert).
</p>

<p>
  element or property?
  it is hard to differentiate between elements (pure types) and properties (mixed types).
  generally, there are two solutions:
  1. mental gender is ternary
  2. mental gender is binary
  1. one element is masculine (fire),
  one element is feminine (earth),
  two elements are bisexual (air + water).
  2. two elements are masculine (fire + water),
  two elements are feminine (air + earth).
  here we prefer the second solution (mental gender is binary),
  so that "masculine" is a property, not a type.
  for example, see the <a href="#william-herrmann">William Herrmann, HBDI, Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument</a>:
  surveys show that "quadrant A ~ male gender",
  and that "quadrat C ~ female gender".
  we assume that males prefer their masculine subtypes (x14),
  so in total, they appear extremely masculine = psychotic = quadrant A.
  ... and that females prefer their feminine subtypes (x23),
  so in total, they appear extremely feminine = neurotic = quadrant C.
  = more property than element = between two elements
  = properties are confused with elements,
  cos education to only one subtype seems very common (so the four properties are used as types).
  the survey also shows, that quadrants B and D are not correlated to gender,
  so we translate the domain B&mdash;D to mental age.

    In 1928, William Moulton Marston identified 
    four primary emotions, 
    each with an 
    initial feeling tone of either 
    pleasantness or unpleasantness. 

    This led to his viewing people's behavior along two axes, with their 
    attention being either "passive" or "active", 
    depending on the individual's 
    perception of his or her environment 
    as either "favorable" or "antagonistic". 

    By placing the axes at right angles, 
    four quadrants form 
    with each describing a behavioral pattern:

    Dominance, which produces activity in an antagonistic environment; with a feeling of unpleasantness until stimulus is acted upon

    Compliance, which produces passivity in an antagonistic environment; with a feeling of unpleasantness until stimulus is reconciled

    Inducement, which produces activity in a favorable environment; with a feeling of pleasantness increasing as interaction increases

    Submission, which produces passivity in a favorable environment; with a feeling of pleasantness increasing as yielding increases

    >Helen Fisher's Personality Test</a>
    <br>
    book: Why Him? Why Her? by Helen Fisher<br>
    <br>
    The dimensions were named:<br>
    13 = Curious/Energetic = general intelligence
    = elevated sex drive = sex is important to a successful partnership<br>
    Cautious/Social Norm Compliant = 24<br>
    Analytical/Tough-minded = 14<br>
    Prosocial/ Empathetic = 23<br>
    4 = serotonin = suppressed sexual desire = suppressed sexual function<br>


    Cautious/Social Norm Compliant = serotonin? = 4 or 24
    Cautious/Social Norm Compliant:
    significantly more likely to be members
    of an organized religious community.
    the Cautious/Social Norm Compliant scale
    may measure, to some degree, serotonergic factors, because
    genetic data associate aspects of the serotonin system with
    religiosity and traditionalism.

    Political Orientation
    Cautious/Social Norm Compliant scale
    politically conservative
    respect for authority and tradition

    traditionalism is linked
    in the biological literature with aspects of the serotonin
    system.

    Prosocial/ Empathetic = estrogen and oxytocin = 2 or 23
    It was also predicted that participants who scored highest
    on the Prosocial/Empathetic scale would be significantly more
    liberal in their political views, because self-reported liberals
    in dozens of countries score higher than conservatives on
    scales of caring/nurturance (Graham et al., 2009), qualities
    associated in the biological literature with the estrogen and
    oxytocin systems (Knickmeyer et al., 2006).

    Consistent with
    the prediction, political conservatism was negatively associated
    with high scores on the Prosocial/Empathetic scale. These data
    further support other research that variability in political values
    is not simply attributable to differences in cognitive style,
    but is also, in part, associated with differences in biological
    factors (Alford et al., 2005; Amodio et al., 2007; Kanai et al.,
    2011).

      DIRECTORS shoot for the stars.
      These men (and women) express traits linked with the testosterone system in the brain.
      They tend to excel at analytical and strategic thinking.
      They are also direct, decisive, exacting and tough minded.
      Directors are good at what scientists call "rule-based systems,"
      aptitudes such as higher math, mechanics, computers, engineering and/or music.
      And they are often competitive, as well as skeptical and emotionally contained.
      Directors approach dating and relationships the same way
      they approach their other interests,
      by rationally analyzing their hopes, needs and intentions.
      Foremost they seek a partner who shares their goals,
      as well as someone who is eager to exchange ideas,
      build theories and talk about science, philosophy, history or whatever interests them.
      <br>
      <br>
      To balance out their forthright style and tendency to make decisions quickly,
      Directors tend to gravitate to partners who weigh alternatives,
      listen actively, handle conflicts deftly and have other well-honed social skills.
      Because they analyze their own emotions, as well as hide them,
      Directors tend to seek mates who are emotionally expressive.
      Because they have difficulty dealing with "controlling" people,
      they tend to be attracted to those who are flexible, even indecisive.
      Thus they often gravitate to Negotiators who have the empathy
      and emotional complexity to handle their forceful personalities.
    </td>
    <td>
      NEGOTIATORS are philosophers.
      These women (and men) express traits linked with the estrogen system in the brain.
      These people see the big picture.
      They are imaginative and intuitive.
      They have superb language and people skills.
      They are also emotionally expressive, as well as agreeable, trusting and compassionate.
      Negotiators seek someone with whom they can make
      an intensely intimate, deeply meaningful, inspiring and spiritual connection.
      <br>
      <br>
      Negotiators, like Directors, prefer to go out with one person
      at a time and to explore the depths of this potential partnership.
      They dislike wasting time on irrelevant, trivial or boring socializing.
      When they find "The One," Negotiators are superb
      at generating and maintaining intimacy with this partner.
      They avoid conflicts with a mate, and make major personal adjustments
      to strengthen this cherished bond.
      They give thoughtful gifts, such as a treasured book or photograph.
      They share their most personal feelings.
      And they want their partner to share his or her feelings too.
    </td>
    <td>
      EXPLORERS are born free.
      They express more of the traits linked with the dopamine system in the brain.
      These men and women love novelty;
      they are willing to take risks to experience adventures of the mind and/or body.
      They are optimistic, energetic, spontaneous, mentally flexible,
      often generous and highly curious and creative.
      <br>
      <br>
      And they often seek a partner who will go adventuring with them:
      another Explorer.
      Because they are friendly and enthusiastic,
      have little interest in rules or schedules,
      and have no desire to control others they can make a date feel comfortable quickly.
      Explorers are also good at listening and talking.
      They are inquisitive,
      so they are likely to ask you about yourself in order to engage you
      and satisfy their curiosity.
      But they tend to play the field and seek as much freedom and variety as possible
      — until they are ready to settle down.
    </td>
    <td>
      BUILDERS are pillars of society.
      Most likely highly expressive of the serotonin system in the brain,
      they are traditional and conventional, as well as cautious, calm and often social.
      These men and women like to build networks;
      community and family are important to them.
      They make good managers because they are orderly, conscientious, thorough and loyal.
      And they respect rules and like schedules.
      Builders seek a stable and predictable team player,
      someone who shares their fidelity to family and tradition.
      <br>
      <br>
      They take courtship seriously, too.
      Builders don't choose a partner impulsively.
      They believe in good manners, old-fashioned courtesy,
      punctuality and well-arranged schedules.
      Builders tend to think concretely; they are literal;
      they like and trust facts. So on a date,
      a Builder is likely to engage in tangible conversations
      - about food, travel, sports, the weather, TV programs and/or movies.
      They are often good at "small talk," short conversations on concrete topics.
      They can be very modest when discussing their achievements.
      And they tend to take the opinions of their friends and relatives seriously.

    Males and females scored in the predicted direction for
    the Analytic/Tough-minded [masculine]<br>
    and Prosocial/Empathetic [feminine] scales
    in North America and also in six other countries tested,
    including both Western and Eastern societies.<br>
    Importantly, a
    sample from a university population (rather than a dating site)
    showed the same results, with even greater odds ratios for the<br>
    Analytic/Tough-minded and Prosocial/Empathetic dimensions,
    and odds ratios closer to one for the other two dimensions.<br>
    There
    were sex differences for some of the other scales, but these were
    exceptionally small<br>
    (e.g., r = 0.004 for the Cautious/Social Norm
    Compliant scale in the North American sample).<br>
    These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the
    Analytic/Tough-minded scale measures some influence by the
    testosterone system,<br>
    and the Prosocial/Empathetic scale measures
    some influence by the estrogen/oxytocin system.<br>
    These data are
    also consistent with the results of two fMRI studies using the

    test: 120-question HBDI assessment "for only 125 Euros",
    "Certified HBDI practitioners are able to purchase the assessment materials
    and have access to the online HBDI assessment center.
    It is unlikely you will be able
    to find the HBDI being offered for free on the internet."
    <br>
    history:
    In 1976, while researching the brain as the source of creativity,
    Ned Herrmann learned of the pioneering brain research<br>
    of Roger Sperry [Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1981],
    Paul MacLean, Joseph Bogen and Michael Gazzanaga.<br>
    From their work it is clear that the brain has four distinct and specialized structures.
    <br>
    Inspired by this research, Herrmann worked with EEG scans [unpublished EEG data!] and,
    later, paper-and-pencil questionnaires to identify four distinct types of thinking,<br>
    each roughly corresponding to one of the brain structures.
    The result of this research is the Herrmann Whole Brain Model.
    <br>
    In August 1979, after many tests, in-depth research, and mountains of data,
    Herrmann had developed a valid self-assessment that enables individuals<br>
    to understand their own thinking style preferences — the HBDI.
    <br>
    -->
    There are four modes: Upper Lower Left Right [elements or properies?].
    The Upper mode is typified by abstract and reasoned ways of thinking.<br>
    In contrast, the Lower mode represents the grounded, gut-level ways of knowing.<br>
    The characteristics of the Upper and Lower modes
    are just as important in establishing a person's distribution<br>
    of thinking preferences as the differences
    between the better-known Left and Right modes are.<br>
    The Left mode is more structured and analytical,
    and the Right mode is more free-flowing and intuitive.

      Alpha programming is accomplished through deliberately subdividing the victim's personality which, in essence,

      Known as Kitten programming, it is the most visible kind of programming

      Due to its evident limitations, however,

  type 1
  alpha
  ambidextrous
  Y shape = two strong arms + one strong leg + one weak leg
  one weak leg = hidden hemiplegia, latent hemiparesis

  https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/brain

  handedness has its roots in the brain—right-handed people
  have left-hemisphere-dominant brains and vice versa

  [Einstein's brain] hemispheres were more symmetrical
  —a trait typical of left-handers and the ambidextrous

  95 percent of righties have brains that strictly divvy up tasks:
  The left hemisphere almost exclusively handles language and speech,
  the right handles emotion and image processing
  —but only about 20 percent of lefties have brains
  that divide up these duties so rigidly

  having the hemispheres manage different tasks
  might increase the brain's efficiency

  "There's an advantage to cerebral dominance
  because it localizes function to one hemisphere," he says.
  "Otherwise, information has to cross back and forth
  across the corpus callosum, and that can sometimes cause problems."

  A strongly symmetrical brain, like Einstein's,
  leaves people open to mental dysfunction,
  but it also paves the way for creative thinking.

  In 2007, geneticists identified a gene on chromosome 2, LRRTM1,
  that seems to be present in most lefties (Molecular Psychiatry, Vol. 12, No. 12).
  The gene has also been linked to schizophrenia [type 1 and type 3?],
  which fits with earlier research
  showing that people with schizophrenia
  are significantly more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous.

  Less-lateralized brains may also be linked to lower IQ scores,
  suggests a study by Corballis, published in Neuropsychologia (Vol. 46, No. 1).
  The study found that left-handers and right-handers had similar IQ scores,
  but people who identify as ambidextrous had slightly lower [IQ] scores,
  especially in arithmetic, memory and [logical] reasoning.

  These results dovetail with Corballis's previous findings
  that ambidextrous people also rate higher on a "magical ideation" scale,
  which measures people's propensity to, for example,
  think that people on television are talking directly to them
  or that they can sense when people are talking about them (Laterality, Vol. 7, No. 11).
  [in my experience, such "magical" phenomena can be produced or amplified by psychedelic drugs like LSD.]
  [telepathy] [subconscious] [feelings] [weak signals] [hidden signals] [silent audio]

  Research suggests that there might be a big advantage to a less constrained brain:
  It might lead to less constrained thinking.
  [liberal] [open minded] [thinking outside the box]

  anecdotal evidence has suggested that
  lefties might think more creatively than right-handers,
  and recent research supports this link

  Just as information is prone to errors as it traverses between brain hemispheres,
  it's also more likely to encounter novel solutions.
  Righties might dismiss an idea as too radical
  [prejudice] [quick to judge] [first impression is stable],
  but nonrighties might be willing to entertain the thought nonetheless,
  and develop a solution that a right-hander's brain would skip right over.
  [creative] [innovative] [research and development]

  lefties earn slightly more money than their right-handed peers who work at the same jobs

  equating left-handedness with creativity
  glosses over the fact that 20 percent of left-handed people
  do have strongly lateralized brains
  and are probably no more creative than right-handers.

  The idea of lefties as creative types "probably refers to
  the subgroup of [left-handers]
  who lack clear dominance in the hemispheres," Corballis says.
  [actually ambidextrous?]

  the human condition itself might be summed up
  as the balance between the brain's asymmetries and symmetries
  —rationality versus creativity,
  novel ideas versus traditional solutions.

  "The asymmetrical brain might even represent science
  and the symmetrical brain, religion," Corballis speculates.
  "An exaggeration, no doubt, but it's fun to think along these lines."

    via
    <a href="http://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Fritz+Springmeier+-+The+Illuminati+Formula"
    >Fritz Springmeier - The Illuminati Formula</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Fritz+Springmeier&iax=images&ia=images">Fritz Springmeier</a> says he is IFA (page 28),
    "which helps explain why he is trying to reform society and religion"

    <br>
    Internalizer-Externalizer = intellectual dimension.
    <br>
    Internalizer = ability to manipulate internal stimuli or symbols without being distracted by the external world.
    <br>
    The internalizer relies more on his own experience and internal landscape [prone to fantasy] and is likely to be less active than externalizers.
    Internalizers are predisposed to the production of mental fantasy.
    <br>
    The externalizer is dependent on input from the outside and is more dependent on relating for the sake of relating.
    <br>
    Internalizer = thinker = psychotic = loner = tough minded = intellectual = "masculine".
    <br>
    Externalizer = talker = neurotic = social = psychosomatic = tender minded = "feminine".
    <br>
    <br>
    Regulated-Flexible dimension = procedural dimension.
    <br>
    a "regulated" person can see details within a whole, but not the whole.
    <br>
    The regulated person is more stimulus-bound and less able to see the "big picture".
    <br>
    The regulated person is more procedurally oriented (linear, narrow mind) and emotionally insulated (cold, good conscious).
    <br>
    Regulated (R) personalities like to have narrow limitations
    on their activity. This makes them suitable for programming. The R's
    readily <b>accept authority</b>, and will not try to step out of the range of their
    <b>habits</b>. The R has a marked ability to <b>learn without understanding</b> [imitate] [copy] [reproduce]. They
    easily learn material by rote, because they do not need to understand it 
    before they will learn it. This is another asset they have that the
    programmers like. 
    <br>
    The flexible person is involved with relationships
    and has attention diverted from step by step procedures (open mind, multi tasking, easy to distract).
    <br>
    In theory, the regulated person has a high sensory threshold
    (numb, high standards, choosy, narrow expectations, few big joys)
    which is therefore satisfied less often than a flexible person (many small joys).
    <br>
    <br>
    Adaptable-Uniform = social dimension.
    [modality in astrology]
    [version in Carl Jung]
    [subtype]
    <br>
    The Role Adaptable-Role Uniform dimension refers to a person's skill
    in meeting demands that others make of him [follow others].
    <br>
    The adaptable person easily plays a variety of roles,
    being charming and moving easily in many different situations
    always making good first impressions.
    [meet expectations of others]
    [weak opinions]
    [trust others]
    [follow others]
    [defensive]
    [wants to be liked]
    [Charisma]
    [charming]
    [country singer]
    [bring together many people]
    <br>
    The role uniform person is able to handle only a few social roles at best
    and is often said to be socially inept.
    [make expectations for others]
    [strong opinions]
    [influence others]
    [lead others]
    [aggressive]
    [wants to be right]
    [stubborn]
    [rigid]
    [righteous]
    [computer programmer]
    <br>
    The behavior is most apparent in new social situations,
    since the role uniform may comfortable and accepted in a very familiar situation.
    <br>
    The role adaptive can suffer from making good first impressions
    and then not understanding the unrealistic expectations others place upon him.
    <br>
    <br>
    nature and nurture:
    The PAS is based on premises (among others) that behavior is determined by both heredity and environment.
    behavior is determined by an interacting system of traits.
    these traits can be modified through learning.
    <br>
    Because Gittinger believed genetic-based differences exist in people,
    which is one of the bases for the Monarch Programming, his work was not
    accepted by main stream psychology.

      big five claims to have five orthogonal domains, but this is bullshit.
      <br>
      all models of personality can be translated to three domains:
      <br>
      move (14/23)
      x sense (13/24)
      x subtype (cardinal/mutable/fixed)
      <br>
      = 2 x 2 x 3 = 12 types = 12 zodiac signs.
      <br>
      two domains are binary, one domain is ternary (allows a neutral value).
      <br>
      you can derive five domains from this "base model",
      but these five domains can NOT be orthogonal.
      <br>
      five domains:
      <br>
      1. sense = conscientiousness
      <br>
      2. move = neuroticism
      <br>

      Sometimes their energy can be seen as a fault<br>
      when they don't want to sit still<br>
      or when they interrupt you to share their ideas.<br>

      can help them develop into creative, happy adults.

      The sensitive child has a naturally calm and easy-going personality.<br>
      They are often called the "peacemaker" of the family because they don't like conflict.<br>

      They are generally quieter and are often asked to "talk louder" or "hurry up."<br>
      They do things on their own time.
      <br>
      A parent may get frustrated when they ask their type 2 child<br>
      to clean his room and come back 15 minutes later to find it still not done.<br>
      When you recognize your child's innate "sensitive" personality,<br>

      He or she was born with a drive to get things done, usually in their own specific way.<br>
      Type 3s are usually told to "calm down" or "stop being so demanding."

    im type 1, with subtype 4 = leo in the zodiac

    > I'm pretty sure I was a determined child

    this is so important.

    whenever i read something, i wonder: whats his type?

    disclosing one's own type upfront (self-intro) would be awesome,
    but sadly we lack a universal namespace (naming system) for these four types,
    four humors, four elements, four directions, four colors, ...

    "hi, my color is red!" - (what? what does HE mean with this?)

      forced solitary confinement (jail),<br>
      loss of something expensive (1000 USD phone) or important (ID card),<br>
      sensory deprivation (starvation, craving for tobacco, etc.).<br>

      children who show some distress when their caregiver leaves,
      but are able to compose themselves quickly when the caregiver returns.

      will explore freely while the caregiver is present,
      typically engages with strangers,
      is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs,
      and is generally happy to see the caregiver return.

      Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.

      Secure attachment is the most common type of attachment relationship seen throughout societies.

      Securely attached children are best able to explore
      when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need.
      When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also,
      assuming the parent's assistance is helpful,
      educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future.
      Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style.

      Cassidy-Marvin Method
      The central finding of studies using the C-M method in
      middle class, normative samples is that children classified as
      secure were better adjusted than anxiously attached children.
      Specifically, they were more obedient, had more
      positive affect, experienced less fear of strangers, were more
      emotionally open to negative feelings, were more socially
      competent, and had better emotion regulation in the school
      years than insecure children.

      all studies using the C-M method reported perplexingly high numbers of at risk children who were assessed as
      securely attached.

      Application of the PAA to middle class, normative
      samples indicates that securely attached children had the
      highest Bayley developmental quotients (DQ)i and more
      adaptive behavior reports (whereas A/C children performed
      the worst), had the highest expectations of maternal availability when care was needed, and showed the best conflict
      regulation skills at four years of age.

      self-regulating:

      anxious-ambivalent.
      When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed.
      The child is generally ambivalent when the caregiver returns.

      displays of anger (ambivalent resistant, C1) or
      displays of helplessness (ambivalent passive, C2)
      towards the caregiver on reunion
      can be regarded as a conditional strategy
      for maintaining the availability of the caregiver

    <br>
    by The United States Institute of Peace
    <br>
    <br>
    type 5 (Accommodator) is probably a mix of type 2 and type 3. quote:
    <br>
    <br>
    "Accommodators have a harmonizing approach to conflict.
    They often focus on supporting others in a conflict situation
    and are adept at placating people in uncomfortable situations.
    Accommodators often gain strong appreciation from others involved in a conflict.
    <br>
    <br>
    Weaknesses: Accommodators may build up resentment from denying their own needs.
    It also may be difficult for those who want to get to the root of the problem
    to work with Accommodators who tend to focus on making others happy."

      Competers are known for being persuasive and direct.
      They know the result they want in a conflict situation, and they go for it.
      Their strengths are that they are often passionate about their views
      and dedicated to pursuing their convictions.
      Competers are good at making quick decisions,
      and tend not to waste time, which is especially helpful in the time of crisis.
    </td>
    <td>
      Avoiders tend to step away from conflict.
      They often keep their opinions to themselves in conflict situations
      so as not to continue or escalate the conflict.
      They are often admired for having a calming, quiet presence in the face of crisis.
    </td>
    <td>
      Compromisers approach conflict with the goal of compromise.
      They tend to think about what they are willing to give up
      and what they are willing to hold on to,
      and try to gear communication
      to focus on this give and take for all parties.
      It is a good way to promote cooperation.
      It can be done fairly quickly when both parties are engaged.
    </td>
    <td>
      Problem Solvers tend to want to discuss all the details of a problem
      and work through it together
      so that everyone gets what he or she wants and is happy in the end.
      Their strengths are that they tend to welcome differences,
      build high-levels of trust and mutual understanding in relationships.
      There is also the potential to learn from creative problem solving.

      Daria is a deadpan cynic. She is naturally intelligent but also highly apathetic and somewhat lazy, showing no motivation to apply anything above the minimum required effort and never taking part in extracurricular activities by her own volition, entirely content to coast through high school with her inherent academic talents. Because of this lack of engagement with other students, in addition to her often bored or pessimistic expression and status as an outsider, she is commonly perceived as being very unhappy; while she considers herself realistic and in "The Misery Chick" she clarifies she's not nihilistic, she will occasionally appeal to nihilism and even consideration of suicide for the sake of an offhand joke.

      More intelligent than his friends.
      His Five-Man Band equivalent can do research for the group
      or explain some of the tougher concepts to the rest of the band or the audience,
      but this variant is primarily geared towards
      Lampshading the relative stupidity for the others

      Or maybe just the guy who comes the closest to being sane most often.
      Every zany gang must have a straight man,
      and the other three leads have to share one.
      While his (or her, although the role is usually male) friends act out,
      the Normal Guy's role is to Lampshade and be embarassed by their behaviour.
      He will be more successful with the opposite sex than his friends,

      34? The Pervert

      He usually takes one of two common forms
      - the Loveable Sex Maniac whose high sex drive is his most memorable trait,
      or the Comedic Sociopath, who has bursts of hilarious violence.
      In lighter examples, certain concepts may be Played for Laughs,
      whereas in darker examples the character may draw on Black Comedy Rape.

      24? The Butt Monkey

      A character who serves as a target for the others' jokes.
      There are a few tropes that could make the Band's Butt Monkey;
      The Ditz, the Extreme Doormat or others.
      This member has remarkably less charisma than his friends
      or is a better target for jokes.
      The others will pick on him frequently
      and make him the target of practical jokes.
      Sometimes, however, this character may get one over on his bandmates,
      and this will thoroughly humiliate the others.

They're aligned with the senses (earth = smell, water = taste, fire = sight, air = touch and "akasha" note  = sound. They're also aligned with the chakras, which represent their ladder: Muladhara at the bottom, Swadhisthana in the genitals, Manipura in the stomach/solar plexus, Anahata in the heart, Vishudda in the throat and Ajna in the forehead.

      <br>
      Testosterone Rules!<br>
      The Choleric personality type is associated with testosterone, and although every temperamental makeup is represented by members of both genders, most choleric people are men.
      <br>
      practical<br>
      successful<br>
      independent<br>
      goal-oriented<br>
      analytical<br>

      work is fun<br>
      very practical<br>
      naturally gifted businesspeople<br>
      build successful businesses that thrive and benefit others<br>
      never do well in a subordinate position – they are all about independence<br>
      Exact Sciences: ability to systematize everything (math)<br>
      have a hard time trying to understand why the approaches they use for solving a mathematical problem cannot be used when addressing relationship issues. [until they find THE LOVE FORMULA, like milahu/alchi]<br>
      Testosterone also contributes to their spatial skills. [orientation in landscape, reading maps]<br>
      Their spatial skills can be reflected in musical and athletic ability, particularly sports that require spatial skills, such as soccer.<br>
      Their concentration is deep and narrow. When they are busy with something, Cholerics are simply not capable of noticing other things that are going on around them. [fire "burns" for its passions, interests - until burnout]<br>
      <a href="https://psychologia.co/types-of-thinking/">analytical and logical</a>.<br>
      prefer to prove themselves with action and put the talk aside<br>
      confident, bold, high self-esteem.<br>
      can be rude, impolite, aggressive, radical.<br>
      Highly independent people with not much respect for diplomas and other credentials, they are armed with their autonomy and independence.<br>
      highly competitive<br>
      work long and hard<br>
      rarely satisfied, never happy, high expectations (be excellent!), perfectionistic<br>
      generally avoid socializing unless they are interested in the conversation, which of course should be somehow related to their goals (task focus)<br>

      <a href="https://psychologia.co/phlegmatic-personality/">Phlegmatic</a>
      <br>
      the Web Thinkers
      <br>
      People with phlegmatic personality are unassuming, agreeable, and intuitive.
      They possess the ability of "web thinking" [endorphine = earth],
      i.e., to see the relationship between many bits of data they collect.
      <br>
      unassuming<br>
      agreeable<br>
      intuitive<br>
      imaginative<br>
      empathetic<br>
      warm<br>
      cooperative<br>
      trusting<br>
      considerate<br>
      <br>
      Phlegmatic Skills
      <br>
      They have an incredible skill to gather facts, classify them into different categories, and then see the relationship between seemingly contradicting elements. [12, patient, parasympathetic]
      Essentially, it is the ability to read between the lines. Phlegmatic men and women don't do very well at memorizing separate unrelated facts. They grow bored and annoyed. To be excited by the process, they need to be able to generalize.
      <br>
      It's all about the estrogen!
      <br>
      Phlegmatic personality traits are linked to estrogen, which is present in both men and women. However, phlegmatic people are predominantly females.
      Millions of nerve fibers connect the two hemispheres of the brain, and estrogen builds more nerve connections between the remote areas within each region. These connections assist the ability of "seeing a bigger picture" or "web thinking".
      <br>
      – These people are imaginative; they like to <a href="https://psychologia.co/types-of-thinking/">think abstractly</a>. For example, they will try to read your body language and tell you what you were thinking.
      <br>
      – Phlegmatics want to know other people's deepest feelings and strive to build intimate attachments with about everyone in their lives.
      <br>
      They are interested in cooperation and interpersonal harmony, and this is why they preserve their family ties and friendships. When there is a conflict, they seek to agree and to satisfy the needs of everyone involved.
      <br>
      – These men and women are very empathetic and compassionate. They try to understand what the other person is thinking and feeling, then to respond accordingly, which allows them to connect with that person. People with a phlegmatic personality are very agreeable.
      <br>
      – Phlegmatics could be described as cooperative, considerate, charitable, sympathetic, trusting, and warm. They like to express their feelings, sometimes dramatizing their experience, which is the evidence of high estrogen activity.
      <br>
      – Phlegmatic men and women seek to contribute to society at large. They strive to fight cancer, donate to orphanages, and help the poor. They also strive to greater self-knowledge, which they see as a must.
      <br>
      On the negative side, people with a phlegmatic personality can be indecisive and unable to focus on essential details. They keep ruminating on the bigger picture while ignoring the crucial aspects.
      Their TALKATIVEness can be annoying, and because they seek connection, they may appear NEEDY [clingy], constantly demanding reassurance.
      They may be trying to understand you, but they also may assume that you see and feel the world the same way they do.
      They might take criticisms as an insult [personally offended] and pout for days, weeks, and months. Finally, they are very prone to depression.

      <a href="https://psychologia.co/sanguine-personality/">Sanguine</a>
      <br>
      The Sanguine personality is affected by a chemical called dopamine, which makes these people intensely curious and creative.
      Their curiosity can be expressed in their love for reading and different kinds of knowledge.
      Sanguine people usually possess high amounts of energy, so they may seem restless and spontaneous.
      <br>
      cheerful<br>
      curious<br>
      creative<br>
      optimistic<br>
      energetic<br>
      spontaneous<br>
      impulsive<br>
      assertive<br>
      goal-oriented<br>
      <br>
      The Luxurious Lifestyle
      <br>
      This type of personality loves the life of luxury; they like to impress others by their expensive clothes, designer accessories, and flashy cars.
      If choleric people thrive on the money-making process itself, sanguine people know how to enjoy money, luxury, and comfort like nobody else.
      They are big spenders. If they can afford it, they travel a lot. They are likely to stay in splendid hotels, enjoying exciting safaris and luxury cruises, deriving full happiness and pleasure from their wealth.
      They will indulge in their rich, comfortable, and sumptuous living effectively ignoring the world's problems and crises.
      <br>
      The Risk Takers
      <br>
      Sanguine Personality Traits - the Boredom BustersPeople with a sanguine personality are willing to take risks for the sake of pursuit of their diverse interests.
      These people feel bored if they are not absorbed by something intriguing.
      Their constant cravings for adventure and novelty are the primary motivating force behind their actions, decisions, and choices.
      People with a sanguine personality adapt quickly and, generally, can play many roles.
      Buoyant, lively and optimistic, they have the ability to absolutely charm the pants off anyone that seeks their attention.
      Their need for variety and luxury explains why they prefer to live in big cities where they can satisfy their desires much easier.
      <br>
      The Boredom Busters!
      <br>
      Sanguine people are very poor at tolerating boredom.
      Routine jobs, repetitive experiences, and dull companions annoy and irritate them.
      For the most part, they will try to avoid routine and monotony at all costs.
      Even more so, they love and thrive on interruptions because they get energized during these small changes in course.
      These people are impulsive, and they will often find it difficult to control their cravings and may struggle with weight [endomorph = air].
      More than any other types of personality, this temperament is more susceptible to smoking, alcohol, drugs, gambling, and risky behaviors.
      Their spontaneity reflects in last-minute plans and moments of intellectual discovery.
      Sanguine people are usually more creative than other types, be it poetry, music, theater, art, business, or cooking.
      Sadly, they are also most susceptible to chemical imbalances, addictions, and mood disorders.
      This personality type is characterized by curiosity and having a wide range of interests.
      People of this type seem to be hungry for knowledge – some of them are walking encyclopedias, while some others visit almost every country in the world.
      Many stay in school years and years after their peers have graduated.
      They will do almost anything to satisfy their always present need to be absorbed by something meaningful and exciting.
      As a result, they will often end up having several degrees.
      <br>
      The Dopamine Course!
      <br>
      Dopamine activity promotes motivation and goal-oriented behavior, as well as enthusiasm, focus, assertiveness, incentive, and drive to achieve.
      However, sanguine people are so busy with their many interests that they will procrastinate completing their tasks.
      They are just too busy to think about deadlines and actually finishing one task before going ahead to begin another.
      These people are very autonomous and unconventional.
      They trust their impulses and take risks.
      Their motto is: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained".
      They launch into projects that seem sure to fail but somehow always manage to win big!
      People with sanguine personality are extreme optimists who make it their job to seek joy and find a way to be happy.
      These are sensation seekers that derive pleasure from highly arousing experiences; they "drink life" and enjoy it to the fullest.

      <a href="https://psychologia.co/melancholic-personality/">Melancholic</a>
      <br>
      Patient, Orderly and Attentive<br>
      Men and women with melancholic personality share many traits – they tend to be loyal to their family and friends and extremely careful.
      Respectability and moral issues are particularly important to them; they prefer to follow typical "norms" of society and family traditions.
      <br>
      loyal<br>
      careful<br>
      traditional<br>
      respectful<br>
      calm<br>
      confident<br>
      orderly<br>
      persistent<br>
      patient<br>
      <br>
      They are respectful to authority, follow the rules, and feel comfortable in hierarchies where structure, regulations, and order are implemented.
      They need want to be a part of the larger community.
      They see their loyalty to it as a duty.
      Melancholic personality traits are associated with serotonin [water?], which suppresses aggressive tendencies.
      That explains why melancholic people are calm and self-confident, deeply attached to their family and community, and loyal.
      They are very orderly and don't like unpredictability – they enjoy making definite plans and keeping schedules.
      They love routines, which they find relaxing, and this should not come as a big surprise – any repetitive motion increases serotonin levels.
      It is relaxing in its nature, but nobody enjoys it more than a melancholic!
      <br>
      Attention to Detail
      <br>
      These people pay attention to detail:
      They remember special dates, anniversaries, and events.
      They will remember details about their neighbors and colleagues.
      Melancholics don't see family and social ties as something that limits their freedom and flexibility as this could be with sanguines or cholerics.
      To them, these are safety nets, kind of a soft place to fall but on a much grander scale.
      It is also something that adds meaning to their life.
      Since society and family ties are such an essential part of their daily lifestyles and routines, they absolutely can't see themselves without it.
      Take this part away from them, and they will be devastated.
      That is why the melancholic is not likely to be somebody who would marry a foreigner or leave to another country for permanent residence.
      <br>
      It's All About The Order!
      <br>
      Melancholics need to be orderly even in their speech.
      They will express themselves precisely, accurately, providing all of the relevant information.
      If you interrupt them or ask them a question, they will think you are not interested in what they are talking about.
      Unlike Sanguine people, they hate distractions and get frustrated by them.
      If you want to impress them, don't talk about your big ideas.
      Instead, give them precise information and stick to the details.
      Their need for order is expressed even in their jokes – they won't be a fan of nonsense humor or unresolved humor.
      Even their jokes reflect order, predictability, and closure.
      <br>
      Accuracy Counts!
      <br>
      People with a melancholic personality are thorough and accurate.
      They are process-oriented and like to pursue their goals in a precise, straightforward way.
      Before they start a specific task, they need to organize themselves and break down the task into the manageable steps.
      An average melancholic is not the kind of person that will work well under pressure.
      To be comfortable in a given situation, they need to be in a clear-cut place where the details are known and proven.
      <br>
      Patience is a Virtue!
      <br>
      Melancholic Personality Traits - Patient, Orderly and Attentive
      <br>
      Melancholics are persistent and patient.
      They don't get bored easily and excel at tasks that require attention and repetition.
      Interestingly, repetitive actions raise levels of serotonin even more.
      That is why some people repeat the same movement over and over when they are anxious.
      <br>
      The Taste Test
      <br>
      Their orderliness is also reflected in their tastes.
      Melancholics love geometrical designs that are simple, orderly, predictable, repetitive, and symmetrical.
      If you give a melancholic man one striped shirt and hundred shirts with asymmetrical design, he will be wearing that one striped shirt every day.
      Asymmetry makes them too uncomfortable.
      <!--
        Note, however, that most people are a mix of several personality types that make them much more flexible.
      -->
      <br>
      The Melancholic Manager
      <br>
      These people make excellent managers and administrators because they follow the rules and stick to the facts.
      Even more so, they are reliable and make it a point to maintain social ties.
      They are superb at managing people, whether it is at work or at home.
      One of their strongest needs is the need to belong, and this is why they want to be reliable, respectable, and charitable.
      Their emotional well-being depends on their social networks.
      <br>
      Pride
      <br>
      Melancholics are proud of their accomplishments – they will display their trophies, medals, diplomas, certificates, and photos with influential people.
      Generally, they want to do the things in an accepted way; they prefer to plan things in advance and to know ahead of the time what they are going to do.
      <br>
      The Negatives
      <br>
      On the negative side, people with a melancholic personality may become close-minded, dogmatic, and stubborn.
      They also tend to turn to pessimism which may turn into fatalism, believing that nothing will ever change for better.
      Sometimes they get overly critical and judgmental because they often believe in their own moral superiority.
      Their frugality may turn into stinginess.
      Some melancholics can become fixated on the past. They can ruminate for hours how their life would be if they did or chose something else in the past.
      Also, they may have difficulty with stopping what they are doing, so hoarding is often a very common problem.

      These people can process information in the form of codes and complex symbols — something you can't see or touch.
      Many scientific discoveries were possible because of this ability.

      earth + water = 2+4 = P+M = II+IV = Type II + Type IV.
      While there is no initial natural attraction here [both are passive], Type II and Type IV still get involved with each other; and when that happens, the relationship is very stable.
      Both look for a lasting relationship. Both have excellent social skills. Both are loyal.
      Type II and Type IV are particularly effective as parents [both are mentally old] and raise happy children [at least from the parent's point of view].

      air + fire = 3+1 = S+C = I+III.
      These two types are almost opposites of each other and rarely end up together. [half opposite elements air and fire]
      However, this doesn't mean they don't have the potential for a healthy and lasting relationship.
      Both types are highly independent and self-sufficient and will give each other plenty of personal space.
      Type III enjoys the spontaneity of Type I [air], and Type I is impressed by the analytical mind of Type III [fire].
      On the negative side of things, Type III may sometimes see Type I as foolish and lazy [air], while Type I may decide that Type III is just a bore [fire, inhibiting].

      These two could not be more different [opposite elements air and water], and still, they end up together quite often.
      Strangely enough, this seemingly unlikely union of impulsive and adventurous Type I [air] and calm and cautious Type IV [earth] works just fine.
      Their differences can compensate for each other, which makes for a very balanced couple.
      Problems may arise because of their different attitudes towards money.
      Type I is a fun-loving spender [air], while Type IV is a saver [earth].
      Type IV may regard his / her partner as irresponsible [air], while Type I may refer to Type IV as "a ball and a chain" [earth, inhibiting].

  <tr>
    <td>
      Work style C
      <br>
      "leader"
      <br>
      You are a natural leader. Bold and energetic, you naturally take charge of any situation. Your superb problem-solving skills allow you to handle complex business challenges and unexpected situations.
      You know how to assess a problem quickly and accurately. Moreover, you aren't a hesitant type and can make swift and effective decisions.
      You are an ambitious person, and you define yourself by your job. While your approach is very strategic and goal-oriented, you are not afraid to take calculated risks. In addition, you are open to new ways of thinking and to learning from others, which helps produce original work.
      You are good at time management and enjoy planning and building to-do lists. Having said that, you do not get stuck researching and planning. You know when to pull the trigger.
      You constantly scan your environment, looking for opportunities to advance yourself and your organization. Your ideal job should be both challenging and rewarding.
    </td>
    <td>
      Work style A
      <br>
      "worker"
      <br>
      Your career is a major part of your identity, and the quality of your work is outstanding! You accomplish tasks effectively and with great attention to detail. "Good enough" is never enough for you, and a half-finished job is unacceptable.
      You honor deadlines, and if you promise that something will be done by a specific date, rest assured, you will deliver on time.
      You are not one of those innovative types and prefer to follow established procedures to get a guaranteed result. You hate wasting time and money and focus on being productive and cost-conscious.
      You like to be busy and do not look forward to vacations. To you, work comes before leisure and even before your family and friends.
      You want to work in stable organizations with a clear structure and order. You need clear instructions and a good amount of privacy to be able to concentrate on your job. You are most satisfied when you can produce something tangible.
      When put in a leadership position, you lead by example. Being a task-oriented person, you may sometimes fail to meet the emotional needs of your team members.
    </td>
    <td>
      Work style B
      <br>
      "curious"
      <br>
      You certainly have a lot to offer.
      First of all, you contribute your originality and your ability to see the bigger picture. Because you don't focus on details, you can see how all parts fit in together.
      Second, you are a very relationship-oriented person and can be successful in any position that requires communication.
      Because of your perfectionistic tendencies, you may have a little bit of a problem finishing tasks on time. Even when you do finish a project, it may still be incomplete in your mind. You always feel like things can be revised and improved.
      You aren't very good at following rules and regulations because you think that it kills creativity. You need a lot of privacy and a lot of freedom so that you can get things done in your own style.
      Generally, you do not seek leadership positions, but if you have to be a leader, you lead very gently – encouraging instead of giving orders, suggesting rather than criticizing.
    </td>
    <td>
      Work style D
      <br>
      "connect"
      <br>
      You contribute your positivity, optimism and energy, and your co-workers definitely enjoy having you around.
      Another reason they like you is because you accept them as they are, without trying to change them or make them more like yourself. Because you have this ability to understand people, you know how to motivate them or how to make them feel better about their situation at work.
      On top of that, you are great at idea generation. Because you tend to look outside of yourself, you see a lot of possibilities and opportunities.
      Your focus is rather scattered and your knowledge is wide, including many different seemingly unrelated topics. This allows you to make unusual connections and come up with original ideas.
      Your networking skills are another thing that sets you apart. You connect people, ideas, resources and businesses for everyone's benefit.
      Having said that, you have two issues that may sometimes affect your career development:
      you are not the most punctual person in the world.
      you aren't good at forcing yourself to do things you don't enjoy doing.

      In summary, temperament is the combination of traits we were born with [basetype, nature, old nature, old testament];
      character is our "civilized" temperament [strongest subtype, nurture, new nature, new testament];
      and personality is the "face" we show to others [all subtypes].

      >The team</a> is evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers
      with few professional accomplishments.
      Teammates jump in and out of discussions.
      People interject and complete one another's thoughts.
      When a team member abruptly changes the topic,
      the rest of the group follows him off the agenda.
      At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn't actually end:
      Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.
    </td>
    <td>
      The team is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful.
      When you watch a video of this group working,
      you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert,
      and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do.
      When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops,
      reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track.
      This team is efficient.
      There is no idle chitchat or long debates.
      The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands
      so everyone can get back to their desks.

      On this team, people may speak over one another,
      go on tangents and socialize
      instead of remaining focused on the agenda.
      The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer.
      But all the team members speak as much as they need to.
      They are sensitive to one another's moods
      and share personal stories and emotions.
      While Team B might not contain as many individual stars,
      the sum will be greater than its parts.
    </td>
    <td>
      This team may be filled with smart people,
      all optimized for peak individual efficiency.
      But the group's norms discourage equal speaking;
      there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information
      that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid.
      There's a good chance the members of the team
      will continue to act like individuals [selfish, strong borders] once they come together,
      and there's little to suggest that,
      as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.

<p>
  what does the map tell us?<br>
  the map shows "humans and their relations".<br>
  the map can answer the question:<br>
  what humans are "naturally close" to me?<br>
  and what humans are "naturally distant" to me?<br>
  in short, who are my friends, and who are my strangers?
</p>

<p>
  the hardest question is: who is who?<br>
  more precise: who does embody what "inner values"?<br>
  the good news is: inner values can be seen or measured.<br>
  the bad news is: inner values can be hidden or ignored.
</p>

<p>
  how can we see inner values?<br>
  two ways:<br>
  1. from absolute signs.<br>
  2. from relative signs.<br>
  <br>
  with "absolute" we mean: isolated, alone, no relations with other humans.<br>
  with "relative" we mean: connected, bound, in relations with other humans.
</p>

<p>
  what are absolute signs of inner values?<br>
  1a. the "long or broad" test.<br>
  1b. the "william sheldon" test.<br>
</p>

<p>
  what are relative signs of inner values?<br>
  "tell me who your friends are,<br>
  and i tell you, who you are."<br>
  for this way, we must know the inner values of other people,<br>
  so we can observe "closeness or distance" relative to our test person.
</p>

<p>
  body type and mate choice.<br>
  we use body type to predict mate choice.<br>
  <br>
  mate choice and body type.<br>
  and we use mate choice to predict body type.<br>
  <br>
  our system is dualistic by design.<br>
  we do not separate psychology and sociology<br>
  into two separate sciences,<br>
  but we treat psychology and sociology<br>
  as two sides of one coin, called mental chemistry, or alchemy.
</p>

<p>
  static and dynamic.<br>
  the properties gender and move are static, or absolute.<br>
  the properties age and sense are dynamic, or relative.<br>
  relative properties are "secondary" as in,<br>
  only a "reaction" to static/absolute/primary properties.<br>
  static properties tell us "who is this?"<br>
  and dynamic properties tell us<br>
  "how does he react to his static properties?"<br>
  "how does he cope with his absolute values?"<br>
  extravert sense is proud of its own move.<br>
  introvert sense is ashamed [TODO better word] of its own move.<br>
  1 = fire = extravert psychotic = smart and proud of it.<br>
  2 = earth = introvert neurotic = strong but ashamed of it.<br>
  3 = air = extravert neurotic = strong and proud of it.<br>
  4 = water = introvert psychotic = smart but ashamed of it.
</p>

<p>
  two classes: vagotonic and sympatonic. [vagotonia and sympatheticotonia = parasympathetic and sympathetic (nervous system bias)]<br>
  "class" is a "secondary" value, or "virtual" property.<br>
  we get class by multiplication of move and sense.<br>
  to every value, we give the signs plus and minus.<br>
  sample:<br>
  + = extravert sense<br>
  - = introvert sense<br>
  + = neurotic move = "extravert" move [carl jung]<br>
  - = psychotic move = "introvert" move [carl jung]<br>
  now we multiply the signs, and we see:<br>
  fire and earth have the same product = same class,<br>
  and air and water have the same product = same class.<br>
  we call these products ....
</p>

<p>class = diagonal in a (sense x move) square.</p>

      greater peripheral blood concentrations of the adrenal gland derived stress-related hormones cortisol and epinephrine.
      Cortisol stimulates the production of glucose and stimulates the breakdown of muscle protein.
      Epinephrine (adrenaline) increases plasma concentration of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids
      by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen and triglycerides.
      yield less tender carcasses.
      less fat stores (marbling, indicative of a negative effect on quality grade).
      lymphocytes produce less antibodies.
      white blood cells have less bactericidal activity (from 24 hours to 6-to-9 days post-weaning)
      which may make these calves more susceptible to pathogenic bacteria.

      blue lodges, blue Masonry:
      Blue is the fundamental colour of ancient, free and accepted masonry, or that branch of speculative freemasonry commonly called craft freemasonry and meeting in what are known as blue lodges. Blue is the fundamental colour because, as a symbol of universal friendship and benevolence, it is intended to remind every brother that in his breast these virtues should be equally extensive. The degrees of craft freemasonry are the basis of speculative freemasonry and are a prerequisite for membership of all branches of freemasonry.

      BLUE: represents the blue vault or canopy of heaven;
      universally it denotes immortality, eternity, chastity, and fidelity.
      While the pale blue represents prudence and goodness,
      royal blue represents prudence and goodness alone and
      replaced red at the Court in the Middle Ages
      when that colour was given to the ‘lower' classes.
      The colour blue became associated with the terms of prestige such as ‘blue chip' and ‘blue blood.'
      In the Holy Bible we read of white, green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple,
      and, thou shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
      The ancient Jews considered blue a chief religious colour and the High Priest wore a blue robe,
      as well as oaths being taken on a blue altar.

      red lodges, Red Masonry:
      Royal Arch Chapter
      red is an ancient symbol of fervency and zeal,
      which is one of the core teachings of the Royal Arch and its associated degrees.

      RED: crimson or scarlet is considered the symbol of fire and heat
      and traditionally associated with war and the military [fight/rage and flight].
      The colour of blood is connected with the idea of sacrifice, struggle and heroism.
      It signifies charity, devotion, abnegation.
      In Masonry, it is the emblem of faith, fortitude, fervency and zeal.
      On a darker side it is connected with the flames of hell,
      appearance of demons and the apoplectic face of rage.
      Red, scarlet and crimson are also shown
      to signify love, magnanimity as well as that of martyrdom.

      the candidate in the F.C. Degree is enlightened educationally,
      because in this degree we, for the first time,
      instruct the Mason in the Science of Art.
      It represents both the best and the worst in man;
      the colour of brass and honey as well as sulphur and cowardice.
      It reflects on the golden age, golden apples and the quality of the Golden Fleece.
      It was the colour of the patch imposed on the Jews and referred to as the Badge of Infamy.
      It reminds us of the sun and of gold.
      Yellow and gold, as well as silver, is said to have been used in Freemasonry
      since gold is the symbol of the sun [element air, yellow] while silver is that of the moon [element water, blue].
      Universally, yellow represents jealousy, incontinence and treachery,

      acts on vascular and cardiac control is the so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA).
      RSA is described as the physiological and rhythmical
      fluctuation of heart rate at the respiration frequency,
      characterized by heart rate increase during inspiration
      and heart rate decrease during expiration.

      The PN plays a significant role in reproduction.

  Taking Stress Response Out of the Box:
  Stability, Discontinuity, and Temperament Effects on HPA and SNS
  Across Social Stressors in Mother–Infant Dyads

  Stress Response to attachment stress and challenge stress

  attachment stress
  Strange Situation
  cortisol trajectories were higher during attachment stress

  challenge stress
  cleanup task and emotion task battery
  demanding cooperative task batteries
   goal-oriented tasks (cleanup, emotion-eliciting task battery). 
  sAA trajectories were higher during challenge stress

  Varying degrees of mother–infant attunement were found across sessions/systems.

  Infant surgency predicted higher stress measures.
  negative affect and effortful control predicted lower stress measures.
  associations depended on session/system.

  Humans possess two main psychobiological systems designed
  to manage stress encounters: the fast-acting autonomic activity
  associated with the SNS, and the slower acting neuroendocrine
  cascade represented by the HPA axis. The availability of
  noninvasive markers of each—salivary cortisol has been used for some
  time to index HPA output, and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) has
  more recently been validated as a surrogate marker of SNS
  activation (e.g., Chatterton, Vogelsang, Lu, Ellman, & Hudgens, 1996;
  Granger et al., 2006)— has facilitated developmental research
  demonstrating functional implications of these physiological stress
  profiles.

  It has been suggested that HPA and SNS
  serve overlapping but distinct functions in stress mobilization—
  whereas HPA responds preferentially to threatening situations
  eliciting negative affect, SNS response is less valenced and supports
  general arousal needed for challenge-related coping
  (Frankenhauser, 1982; Nigg, 2006). In support of this, toddlers exposed
  to emotion-eliciting tasks showed associations between cortisol
  and negative affect, and between sAA and approach/positive affect, respectively
  (Fortunato, Dribin, Granger, & Buss, 2008).


  The negative affectivity dimension of temperament has
  been related to higher cortisol levels and reactivity (e.g., Fortunato
  et al., 2008; Talge, Donzella, & Gunnar, 2008; van Bakel &
  Riksen-Walraven, 2004) and to sAA (Granger et al., 2006) and
  other measures of SNS (Buss, Goldsmith, & Davidson, 2005). Yet,
  other research has related surgency/extraversion to higher cortisol,
  at least under certain conditions (e.g., Donzella, Gunnar, Krueger,
  & Alwin, 2000; Turner-Cobb, Rixon, Jessop, 2008), and regulation
  to both higher cortisol and sAA (Spinrad et al., 2009). Activation
  of these stress systems may not be a constant feature of a particular
  temperament style. Instead, temperament may focus responsiveness
  by shaping the demands of the situation, the meaning of the
  stressor for the individual, and resources he/she has to manage it.
  A comprehensive understanding of stress system development will
  include not only an appreciation of contextual and
  early interpersonal influences on each system, but also knowledge of which
  temperament dimensions consistently reflect
  physiological baseline and/or response characteristics.


  Surgency [extraversion, Begeisterungsfähigkeit, leicht zu begeistern]
  predicted infant cortisol levels in Session 1 only, with
  stronger associations emerging as the session progressed (see
  Table 3, top panel). No other temperament dimensions3 predicted
  infant cortisol levels or slopes. Infant sAA levels during Session 2
  were predicted by different temperament dimensions at different
  phases; whereas effortful control predicted lower sAA at pre-stress
  and cleanup, negative affect became a significant predictor of
  lower sAA at cleanup only, and surgency predicted higher sAA by
  post-stress (see Table 3, lower panel). Mothers' cortisol and sAA
  were not significantly associated with infant temperament variables.

> what is supposed to be fascist isn't decided by logic

in the end its always humans who decide or define, so its not WHAT you believe but WHO you trust

my definition of fascism? here are some points : P

* organized in large groups (over 150 people)
* large companies
* high agreeableness (big five)
* rationalism (carl jung) (not "antirationalism")
* caring culture (CAF cultural alignment framework) (not "results culture")
* transformational leadership style (workers are naturally eager and only need "soft power" to push them to the right direction, workers need little external motivation)
* long distance relations and dependencies ("oil from africa")
* open borders (large empires)
* weak communities (anti "communism", but rarely under the explicit name of anti-communism)
* melting pot (not cultural mosaic)
* prohibition of serial murder (and compensation with mass murder every 100 years)
* pro life attitude
* collectivism (equal outcome, superficial equality, differences are hidden, caste system, compartments, "no need to know")
* weak individuals with a strong dependency on others (anti-egoist, anti-narciss)
* many weak friends and only one good friend (monism, monotheism, only one god, only one ideal partner, monogamy)
* integrationism and anti-separatism (circular paradigm)
* wet humor (humorology)
* seek compromise
* want to attract many people under a low standard (sacrifice qualitiy to gain quantity)
* want to enforce the same man-made rules on a large territory, so "their people" can travel freely (more nomadic than sedentary, born "refugees" and "migrants")
* expect that words have one universal definition, and when you ask them "what exactly do YOU mean by the word x" then they tell you to "just look it up in the dictionary" (implying that you are stupid, cos you dont know the official definition)
* hunt small criminals as scapegoats for their organized crime (white collar crimes)
* project everything bad to individuals, who then are punished, so the collective is cleansed of the "dirt"
* psychology is used to critizise individuals
* real sociology (in the sense of "critizise the majority") is sabotaged or censored
* majority vote (but how exactly are these majorities generated and manipulated? and who will count the votes?) (again, superficial liberalism to fool the stupid masses)
* overrate education (indoctrination to pacifism)
* forced pacifism, anti nature, equal outcome: the strong are made weak, and the weak are made strong (at least inside the compartments, to create homogen groups)
* underrate "natural order" (believe that all are born equal, believe that criminals and wrongthinkers can be cured by "exorcism" and re-education)
* seek a paradise in heaven, high culture, anti primitive, high tech
* fascinated by astronomy (or airplanes)
* superficial liberalism (neo-liberalism, recruiting oppressed groups for class struggle)
* hidden conservatism ("this 5000 year old prophecy says we must do this")
* shadowbanning, "the wall of silence", have critics "silenced" (or murdered) = hidden conservatism
* leaders cultivate an image of modesty and "arrogant kings deserve to die" (justum necare reges impios)
* tend to wear dresses in uniform color (upper and lower body have the same color)

  every point on the map has six next-ones [peers, neighbors].<br>
  with these six, one is "naturally compatible", either with dialog bond or monolog bond.<br>
  in a dialog bond, both can switch roles between "sender" and "receiver".<br>
  in a monolog bond, one is always sender, and the other is always receiver.<br>
  
  pallas sign = key of seven = one self plus six next-ones.

  element and modality.<br>
  (old name for modality was "pathos", but we prefer to re-use the name from astrology, which is modality.)<br>
  every element can play two "sides", two "play types", two "pathos types".<br>
  the element describes the center, average, balance, mutable modality in the zodiac system.<br>
  the pathos describes the exception, deviation, temporary imbalance, cardinal modality or fixed modality in the zodiac system.<br>
  who can play what?<br>
  the play type always has "diff class".<br>
  vagotonics (fire and earth) can play sympatonics (air and water).<br>
  sympatonics (air and water) can play vagotonics (fire and earth).<br>
  every element can never play his opposite element:<br>
  fire can never play earth.<br>
  earth can never play fire.<br>
  air can never play water.<br>
  water can never play air.

  note:<br>
  vagotonics (1 + 2) are single / singular / individual.<br>
  sympatonics (3 + 4) are multiple / plural / collective.<br>
