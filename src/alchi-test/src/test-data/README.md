we try to keep all important files in the `alchi` monorepo.

these files have a permissive license,  
so we can safely keep a copy here:

* big five from the NPM package `@alheimsins/b5-johnson-120-ipip-neo-pi-r` ([github](https://github.com/Alheimsins/b5-johnson-120-ipip-neo-pi-r/issues)) (MIT license)
   * based on the [International Personality Item Pool](https://ipip.ori.org/) ([public domain](https://ipip.ori.org/newPermission.htm))

other files have unclear licensing,  
so we do not know, if we can include them here.  
we could beg the authors for a permission to copy the files,  
but we have better things to do with our time : )

as a temporary workaround,  
we move these files to separate repositories,  
to minimize loss on DCMA takedowns by copyright trolls.

as a fallback, we provide scraping tools for the client side,  
so if a file is taken down for "copyright infringement",  
our users can still access the data.

if the trolls succeed to takedown our `alchi` monorepo,  
we have multiple backup locations, see [MIRRORS.md](../../../../MIRRORS.md).

ps: fuck all the censorship laws!  
copyright, patents, personal right for privacy,  
politeness, political correctness, war on hatespeech, war on blasphemy, ....  
they all are shit, cos they always only help the wrong people.

pps: we also reject the belief, that only polite people can be smart.  
"iustum necare reges impios" my ass!  
sadly the world is more complex than "black and white".
