happy tree friends - kill the messenger



can you make a comic strip?
in the style of "happy tree friends":
forest animals, bright colors, looking innocent at first sight, ...
12 scenes or 16 scenes would be nice numbers

scene 1:
a terrified animals goes to a police officer.
the terrified animal has a book in one hand (the book cover is the "pallas" symbol ⚴),
and with the other hand it is pointing at the book,
while shouting "someone sent me this book, but i dont understand anything"
and looking really scared/shocked/terrified/worried.

scene 2:
the police officer gives the terrified animal a hug,
now the terrified animal changes its mood to relaxed/calm.
now the police officer has the "pallas" book in his hand.
the police officer says "you did the right thing".

scene 3:
the two animals and some more animals are sitting together at a campfire,
all animals are happy and relaxed,
and the police officer is reading loud from the "pallas" book.

scene 4:
the mood of all animals has changed to "disgusted", including the police officer,
but the police officer keeps on reading from the "pallas" book.

scene 5:
many animals are vomiting/puking, except the police officer.

scene 6:
many animals are lying around, looking exhausted and in pain, covered in puke

scene 7:
the police officer starts looking worried,
but continues reading loud from the "pallas" book

scene 8:
some animals commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head

scene 9:
the police officer gets angry, stops reading,
faces the crowd: "this is enough. you know what to do"

scene 10:
the mob, armed with torches and pitchforks,
is marching to find the "pallas" book author.

scene 11:
the mob burns the house of the "pallas" book author.

scene 12:
on the next day, all animals are happy again,
the sun is shining, a rainbow is in the sky...
everything is "back to normal",
the illusion of order has been saved once again.

You can do anything with Stable Diffusion. It is by far the least restrictive.

The core advantage of Stable Diffusion is that you can install it locally.

You need minimum 6GB NVIDIA GPU and at least 24GB RAM, as far as I know.

Grab Easy Diffusion for starters, run the installer then launch Easy Diffusion from the desktop

the plot is very similar to
South Park S10E05 A Million Little Fibers
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Fibers
https://www.southpark.de/folgen/okhu48/south-park-viel-frottee-um-nichts-staffel-10-ep-5

towelie writes a book (his autobiography)
because he is high
and he thinks "this is a really good idea"
this-is-a-really-good-idea-towelie.gif
https://tenor.com/view/this-is-a-really-good-idea-towelie-south-park-s10e5-a-million-little-fibers-gif-20820709

but the publisher says
"nobody wants to read a book written by a towel"

so towelie replaces "towel" with "person" in his book
and calls himself "Steven McTowelie"
and wears a fake beard and a hat

and suddenly the publisher likes his book
and most people like the book

until they find out that he is a towel
so people start a crusade with torches to kill towelie
because no matter how good the book may be
when it was written by a towel, it is 100% trash
(personal reasons are stronger than rational reasons)
