  TODO chapter: Cheap Answers

  many of my readers will look for cheap answers,
  to answer the question:
  is my hypothesis right or wrong?
  so instead of doing the hard work
  (going the right hand path)
  of conducting the Pallas Experiment
  they will look for form errors like
  "he quoted Hitler" or "he wants to be a serial killer"
  well...
  the problem is,
  these cheap answers say absolutely nothing about my Pallas Hypothesis
  but they say very much about the people
  who deliver or support such irrational arguments.
  basically, these people use personal attacks (ad-hominem attacks),
  because they are mentally unfit (too stupid)
  to confront my Pallas Hypothesis
  on my rational level
  so they pull me down to their emotional level
  and claim that i am "crazy and dangerous",
  and by extrapolation,
  they claim that my Pallas Hypothesis is "crazy and dangerous".
  basically, these people advocate for burning my book,
  to protect their religion of pacifism,
  because "ignorance is bliss".

  The Most Dangerous Person in History Who Ever Lived | Prof Jiang Xueqin
  25:20 — Why Rome Had the Real Motive

  33:14
  This created a profound spiritual crisis for the people living under Roman rule.
  How do you explain the fact that the Romans who are pure evil, who are demonic,
  who are able to conquer the world?
  How do you explain that? You're a good person. You try to live righteously.
  You follow the law, but you're a slave. You're oppressed. You have no freedom.
  How do you find comfort in that? How do you maintain hope when evil triumphs so completely?
  And that's the question Jesus came to answer.
  That's the spiritual problem he was trying to solve.
  And his answer was radical and profound.
  So what did Jesus say? Jesus said this.

  "This World Is a Corpse": Jesus's Core Message

  33:54
  The Romans triumph because the world that we live in is a false world.
  It is a corpse. It's a dead world. This is not the true world.
  So those who most embrace death and evil and hatred will win in this world.
  But this is a false world.
  What matters is the divine realm, the kingdom of heaven, the world of the spirit.
  So understand this. The Romans have won by being evil.
  They have power. They have wealth. They have domination.
  But in the grand scheme of things, they've lost because they've destroyed their own souls.
  They're spiritually dead.
  Think about Achilles. How did Achilles get what he wanted?
  He betrayed Patrick, right?
  He sacrificed his friend to his own pride.
  But because he knows he did evil, he can't sleep.
  He can't eat. He cannot rest.
  All he can do is mutilate Hector's body in a futile rage.
  And that's the Roman way. That's what happens when you build your life on conquest and exploitation.
  You might have external power, but internally you're tormented.
  You're haunted by demons. You can't find peace.
  What Jesus telling us is this.
  I know the world is evil. I know that the rich and the powerful oppress us and we hate them.
  But use your imagination, use your heart, use your empathy
  and look into their minds and you can see how tormented they are.
  See how every day they live with demons that haunt them.
  How they can't truly rest.
  How they hate themselves and they hate the world around them.
  And when you see that for yourself, what you'll realize is they're more pitiful than you are.
  You may be poor, you may be a slave, but at least you're not haunted by demons.
  At least your soul is still alive.At least you still have the capacity for love and joy and connection.
  So if you really want to do good in the world, you have to forgive your enemy.

  35:51
  You have to love your enemy because only by loving your enemy
  can you release your enemy from his demons and that will save the world.

  35:59
  This is the core message. The enemies, the people who oppress us, the rich, the powerful,
  they are Achilles after he's killed Hector.
  They have everything they wanted, but they're spiritually dead.
  They're trapped in a prison of their own making and we have to be like prium.
  We have to approach them with humility and compassion.
  We have to kiss their hand and submit before them
  so that they can be released from their demons.
  And this will make the world a better place.
  Not through revolution, not through violence, not through overthrowing the oppressor,
  but through forgiveness, through love, through maintaining our own spiritual purity even in the face of evil.

  Why This Teaching Was Dangerous to Rome.

  36:45
  Now, think about how radical this message is. Jesus is telling slaves and poor people
  and oppressed populations, don't seek vengeance. Don't hate your oppressors.
  Instead, forgive them, love them, see their suffering. And from the woman perspective, this is incredibly
  dangerous. Why? Because if slaves start to see themselves as spiritually
  superior to their masters, if they stop fearing death, if they stop caring about material wealth and power, then the
  entire system of control falls apart. Roman
  power was based on fear and material incentive. They control people by
  threatening violence and offering rewards. But Jesus is saying none of that matters.

  Godfrey Bloom (UKIP) - All Banks Are Broke (2013)

  "All the banks are broke!"
  The Federal Reserve consisting of a private banking cartel that lives in England, is destroying the livelihoods of every citizen.
  "They're broke because we have a system called fractional reserve banking, which means that banks can lend money that they don't actually have. It's a criminal scandal and it's been going on for too long.
  But after that problem, you have moral hazard, a very significant moral hazard from the political sphere. And most of the problem starts in politics and central banks, which are part of the same political system.
  We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitative easing, but counterfeiting by any other name. The artificial printing of money, which if any ordinary person did, they'd go to prison for a very long time. And yet governments and central banks do it all the time.
  When banks go broke through their own incompetence and chicanery, the taxpayer picks up the tab. It's theft from the taxpayer.
  And until we start sending bankers, and including central bankers and politicians to prison for this outrage, it will continue!"

  I rise again, I'm afraid, to make the same old hory speech that I've been making here for several years,
  and that is it is my opinion that
  you do not really understand the concept of banking.
  All the banks are broke.
  Bank Santandere, Deutsch Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, ... they are all broke.
  And why are they broke?
  It isn't an act of God. It isn't some sort of tsunami.
  They are broke, because we have a system called "fractional reserve banking",
  which means that banks can lend money that they don't actually have.
  It's a criminal scandal, and it's been going on for too long.

  To add to that problem, you have moral hazard,
  a very significant moral hazard from the political sphere.
  And most of the problem starts in politics and central banks,
  which are part of the same political system.
  We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitive easing,
  but counterfeiting by any other name.
  The artificial printing of money,
  which if any ordinary person did, they'd go to prison for a very long time.
  And yet governments and central banks do it all the time.

  Central banks repress the amount of interest that rates are.

  So we don't have the real cost of money.
  And yet we blame the real retail banks for manipulating libore.

  The sheer affronttery of this is quite astonishing.
  It's central banks. It's central banks that manipulate interest rates commissioner.
  And plus underneath all this we talk loosely in a rather cavalier fashion
  do we not about deposit guarantees.
  So when banks go broke through their own incompetence
  and chicainery the taxpayer picks up the tab.
  It's theft from the taxpayer.
  And until we start sending bankers and central bankers and politicians to prison for this outrage,
  it will continue.

    Titicut Follies - Schizophrenia patient Vladimir (1967)

    "I am using your words! You looked at me and you tell me I'm a "schizophrenic paranoia". right? just how do you know? because because I speak well? because I stand up for what I did? - Because you got the psychological testings... - I did? Such as? Tests which asked me how many times do I go to the toilet, do I believe in God, ... I mean, how ridiculous can you get?"
    psychiatry today still works like this, at least here in germany. the prisoners ("patients") are completely ignored ("he is talking shit no matter what he says") and the only solution is "he must take our drugs for some weeks" (antipsychotics), and the "treatment" always takes multiple months so the "doctors" can fill their pockets with money money money. (money rules the world!) (psychiatry is a money printer for "doctors")
    good news: persons at risk (activists, whistleblowers, ...) can create an "advance healthcare directive against psychiatric coercion and legal guardianship" where they can appoint their trusted guardians who in the future can say no to psychiatry (individual will versus individual health).

    "because he questions the validity of the tests"
    because he questions authority.
    police officers hate such "smart asses". police officers are the ones who initiate the "treatment in psychiatry", as an extra punishment for potential resistance leaders. this is 100% political abuse of psychiatry.
    police have sent me to psychiatry multiple times, only because i did passive resistance against the police (which is legal)

    "HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO PROVE YOURE SANE?!"
    you must get an external doctor to come visit you in psychiatry and certify your legal capacity (german: Geschäftsfähigkeit), and then (on the same day) you can write an "advance healthcare directive" (german: Patientenverfügung) where you refuse all psychiatric treatment, and send both documents to the court of law.
    then the judges can decide between the two opinions (psychiatrists versus prisoner). without the certificate of legal capacity, the judges will always say "we are no doctors so we cannot judge your legal capacity so we have to trust the psychiatry doctors when they say you have no legal capacity"
    in theory, the "advance healthcare directive" only works in advance, and once you are in psychiatry, you automatically lose your legal capacity (because you get a "guardian" who acts like your parent and can decide over you)... so ideally, you create the "advance healthcare directive" before you get locked up in psychiatry, but most first-time psychiatry inmates did not see it coming, because you can end up in psychiatry for literally anything (annoying but legal behavior)

    psychiatrists are useful idiots who get lots of money for being stupid and evil, and for blindly trusting "the system".
    it really is that simple.
    the people who initiate these psychiatry incarcerations are police officers or aggressive neighbors or powerful enemies.
    the most cruel thing about psychiatry is that there is no direct confrontation between the accusers and the accused, but the accused is only confronted with "doctors" who talk about the accusations (created by the accusers)...
    so foremost, psychiatry is a violation of the rule of law, because the accused is immediately treated as "guilty", and is immediately punished by imprisonment and psychological torture (constant provocations every day to provoke "aggressive" behavior)

    > They say trust the doctors they say trust science :D
    yep. his "defect" is his distrust in authorities... he is a potential resistance leader.
    50 years ago, they (the fascists) would have called him a "communist"... this is 100% political abuse of psychiatry

    The doc keeps talking over him and interrupting him. Classic narcissist and control tactic…..

    https://youreruiningme.substack.com/p/an-introduction-to-you-are-ruining

    questions:

    - what is Vladimir's birth year? 1940?
    - what is Vladimir's birth place? Russia?
    - what is Vladimir's last name?
    - is Vladimir still alive today? (probably no, he would be about 85 years old)
    - what were the exact justifications for the move from Walpole (prison) to Bridgewater (psychiatry), ideally from both sides: the official side and Vladimir's side. (there are always two sides of a story.) i assume that Vladimir complained to the prison guards ("i should not be here, i am innocent, i dont want to be here for the rest of my life, ...") and the prison guards were quickly fed up with his complaining, so as an extra punishment, they sent him to psychiatry.
    - was Vladimir a "problem child" in his family? (why? aggressive? arrogant? bossy? smartass? always in conflict with his father? no father?)
    - did the three boys (who robbed the liquor store and shot the liquor store owner = former police officer) reveal who was the actual shooter? or did the three boys conspire to keep it a secret who was the actual shooter?
    - when was the liquor store robbery?
    - when was the arrest?
    - were all three boys arrested for the liquor store robbery?
    - when was Vladimir sent to Walpole (prison)?
    - when was Vladimir sent to Bridgewater (psychiatry)?
    - when was "Ma" first sent to psychiatry?
    - was "Ma" sent to psychiatry before Vladimir? did the psychiatrists infer "hereditary mental defects" in Vladimir, because they also knew the story of "Ma"?
    - what diagnosis did "Ma" receive from the psychiatrists?
    - did Vladimir write journals or letters in prison? can you publish these letters? (probably these letters are not as deep as the writings from Ted Kaczynski, but maybe they can help answer some of my questions.)

    the common thread in the stories of Vladimir and "Ma" are "social problems": alpha conflict, dominance conflict, power games, territory conflict, alpha rivalry, political power struggle, covert dominance conflict

    - Vladimir versus prison guards
    - Ma versus Emma

    ...but psychiatrists transform these "social problems" into "psychological problems". winner and loser of the dominance conflict are chosen early (in a secret process where the loser has no way to defend his position), and the loser of the dominance conflict is punished by incarceration in psychiatry: the loser is removed from the winner's territory, and the loser is subjected to torture: toxic environment, junkfood, forced medication and constant provocations from the "alphas" in psychiatry.

    in nature, such dominance conflicts are resolved by physical fights, and the winner takes all, and the loser is either banned or killed.

    dominant individuals subordinate to other dominant individuals only if there is mutual respect and some organized sharing of work (teamwork) (alpha and beta, elite, ruling class).

<!-- TODO BITE Model of Authoritarian Control
  https://substack.com/@milahu/note/c-41881336

  https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model-pdf-download/
  BITE Model of Authoritarian Control
  Many think of mind control as an ambiguous, mystical process that is difficult to define. Mind control refers to a specific set of methods and techniques, such as hypnosis or thought-stopping, that influence how a person thinks, feels, and acts.
  Steven Hassan developed the BITE Model to describe cults’ specific methods to recruit and maintain control over people. "BITE" stands for Behavior, Information, Thought, and Emotional control. The BITE model should be used within the Influence Continuum Model to help determine authoritarian control. Not every group or relationship uses every one of these. Some are universal such as deception (Information control), indoctrinating people to distrust critics and former members, or installing phobias to make people afraid of questioning or leaving.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Deprogramming
  Psychiatry is a legal form of Cult Deprogramming
  think about it:
  - they claim you are "crazy and dangerous" to justify their force
  - they use force to remove you from your everyday environment (because "your environment is a bad influence")
  - they use force to imprison you in their world (because "their environment is a good influence")
  - they use force to give you their "medicine" (because "their medicine is a good influence")
  - all this is funded by the prisoner's "health insurance", which pays about 500 USD per day per prisoner, so of course, this "treatment" takes some weeks or months, while the doctors have practically zero work
  source: i have been to jail for 3 years, and to psychiatry for about 1 year. jail is better than psychiatry: in jail, you have a clear date for your release, and you can refuse all cooperation and have your privacy. in psychiatry, you have no date for your release, you must cooperate (take their "medicine") to be released. so the mainstream culture is just another cult, using force to keep its slaves. that's why we have forced schooling.

  The thing with AI is that
  there's two huge disturbances that come from it.

  The first is that a conservative government
  could completely cut out the managerial class with AI.
  So, the left's power comes from the managerial class, the bureaucracy.
  If you study the demographics,

  (Like middle level manager type positions,
  supervisory but not actually doing the physical work?)

  Leftism is correlated very heavily with lack of agency.
  So high agency work, even if you're poor,
  like small business owners or farmers, tend to be right-wing.
  Low agency work, like mid-level managers, as you say, or teachers or retail workers,
  they tend to go left, because leftism is them.
  It's it's basically a power fantasy.
  "It's we're going to totally rearrange the world
  and have complete control over everything."
  And so what the Unabomber said is that Leftism is an outgrowth of that.

  I kind of keep going off different tangents, but kind of around the AI.

  Oh yeah. So practically every single job you could give to someone in the managerial class,
  you could automate with AI.
  So a conservative government could get completely get rid of the federal bureaucracy
  and then just put in AI to replace it.
  You could get rid of mid-level management at your company and use AI to replace it
  because the exact kind of jobs AI gets rid of the easiest are the paper-shuffling jobs.

  (compiling data, reports, following up on you know managerial-level tasks.)

  51:30
  Yeah. And this creates a huge gap,
  because there's going to be a lot of people who are not employable due to AI.
  There's going to be lots of people who are actually quite high status
  for example lots of doctors could get wiped out due to AI
  because they need years of training in order to get the skills
  that an AI could just look at someone's body language and assess what their medical state is.
  So lots of highlevel jobs will be automated out by AI
  and I think that's going to cause political disturbances
  because I'm from the rust belt, and it was shocking growing up
  seeing how the elites and the society backstabbed my entire region of 100 million people
  and there was zero self-reflection about it.

  elites always get their way, always.

  42:44 nowadays though, the most common political belief,
  across essentially the breadth of the western world,
  is that,
  it isn't left or right in ideological terms,
  it is that voting doesn't matter.
  the most commonly expressed political belief in the western world today
  is that voting doesn't matter.
  and it doesn't matter because it doesn't change things,
  so people become ambivalent or apathetic or frustrated
  by that situation and effectively, in political terms, they drop out.

  43:28 the fact of the matter is,
  as research has shown very conclusively,
  that's true, voting doesn't matter.
  when there is a contradiction between elite wants and popular attitudes,
  elites always get their way, always.
  this has been shown very conclusively
  in a very convincing piece of research done on American politics.
  my supposition here is that this is firstly demoralizing, very obviously,
  and secondly exceedingly dangerous,
  because it means that
  the single largest source of potential political energy in the system or in society
  is latent in the form of a large group of people who are convinced
  that the system is invidiously corrupt,
  and they're just waiting for someone to convince them that they can change it.

  4:46 People have lost faith in the ability of normal politics to solve these problems.
  Politics is meant to be the system by which people solve collective action problems in society.
  And very few people now feel that the political system is able to cure itself.
  In fact, the political system is seen as the problem,
  and the potential for creating change through the normal means of the political system is seen to be exhausted.

  The most common political view in the country is neither left nor right in its orientation.
  It is the expressed view that voting does not matter.

  And that is a perfectly reasonable conclusion for people to draw from the facts,
  particularly the one I just mentioned which is that
  when consulted on the issue of migration over every election since 1945 effectively
  the people have been lied to and gaslighted.

  So, you have these these three factors,
  on top of which you have a couple of others.

  One is that normally a unified and competent elite
  is a strong bullwark against civil war,
  but we do not have a unified and competent elite.
  We have a competency crisis throughout society,
  but particularly within government and bureaucracy.

  This is quite evident across a range of policies
  but also clearly evident (I would suggest) in things like productivity reports
  which we haven't had product actual productivity growth in the country in probably 20 years.
  So there is u we don't have a unified and competent elite.
  We have an incompetent elite,
  one which is distant and alienated from the people which it governs
  whom it holds in varying degrees of contempt.

  On top of that, we have a looming fiscal crisis,
  which is probably maybe six,
  I'm not an economist,
  but it's not a controversial statement at this point
  to say we're probably 6 months off a national fiscal crisis
  of quite large scale, certainly of of of 2008 scale.

  and there's not much left in terms of financial wherewithal to deal with that.

  So it is a perfect storm, fundamentally,
  and your sense as drawn from summer village vets and the like
  of a normality in the situation is a false one.
  It's a false apprehension.
  It's an expression (I would suggest) of normalcy bias.

<!-- TODO A closed mind (types 24) cannot perceive openness,
  but an open mind (types 13) can perceive both the closed and the open.

  "A closed mind (types 24) cannot perceive openness,
  but an open mind (types 13) can perceive both openness and closedness."

  "The limited mind sees only its limits; the expansive mind sees both its own scope and the limits of others."

  "Narrow vision cannot perceive breadth, but broad vision includes the narrow within it."

  "To the one-dimensional mind, only a line exists; the multidimensional mind sees the plane, the space, and the line within them."

  "Small perspectives cannot imagine greater ones; greater perspectives contain the smaller."

  "A mind that cannot reflect sees only what is in front of it; a reflective mind sees itself, others, and the gap between."

  "Greater minds include smaller ones; smaller minds exclude greater ones."

  "The broad mind contains the narrow; the narrow mind cannot contain the broad."

  "Asymmetric Cognitive Inclusion"
  (the higher level includes the lower; the lower cannot include the higher)

  "Cognitive one-way mirror" (a very elegant metaphor)
  This one is excellent because it"s precise and vivid:
  **"Understanding is a one-way mirror:
  the reflective mind sees through it; the unreflective mind sees only its own surface."**
  This perfectly captures that:
  one side is aware of both perspectives
  the other side sees nothing beyond itself

  "Cognitive Ceiling" (Refined)
  Here are a few strong formulations:
  **"Some minds hit a cognitive ceiling they cannot see.
  Minds above the ceiling can see both sides; minds below it cannot see past it."**
  "A cognitive ceiling is transparent from above and opaque from below."
  "Lower levels cannot break through the cognitive ceiling; higher levels can see down through it."
  "Understanding can descend, but misunderstanding cannot ascend."

  "Cognitive one-way road" or "asymmetric cognitive path"
  If you want the "one-way street" feel:
  "It"s a one-way road: greater insight can move toward simplicity, but simplicity cannot travel toward complexity."
  "The path upward is closed; the path downward is always open."

  Some minds have the capacity to reflect on themselves, their limits, and others.
  Some minds do not.
  And this difference is itself invisible from one side.
