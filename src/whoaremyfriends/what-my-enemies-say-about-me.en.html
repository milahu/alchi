<h2>
  What my enemies say about me
</h2>

<div>
  He has schizophrenia.
  <br>
  &mdash; My biological father (M3) around 2017 in his statement to the Munich District Court.
  <br>
  Since then I have the label
  "he is schizophrenic".
  This statement has never been proven
  but is used again and again
  to put me innocently in jail,
  because idiots in power positions
  (parents, teachers, cops)
  want to "get rid of" me
  because they feel "threatened" by my presence.
</div>

<div>
  "Help Mister Police!
  This Pallas book is inciting violence!"
  &mdash; Around 100 anonymous idiots
  who have reported me to the police
  because they are too stupid to read.
</div>

<h3>
  Forbidden at schools
</h3>

<div>
  He is not normal,
  he should be off the streets!
  He believes his passive resistance is legal
  but we just say that he is "suicidal"
  then we put him in psychiatry-jail for life
  until our doctors say he is "healthy".
  In the psychiatry-jail
  he also has no internet,
  that will do him good.
  He just copied his shitty book somewhere from the Internet,
  that's all nothing new.
  <br>
  &mdash; cops in Traunstein, 9.12.2025.
  <br>
  Prehistory:
  I distribute 20 books to children in a school.
  The school director calls the police
  because a "hooded" man (me) runs through the school
  and distributes notes where he says in the chapter "My Death List"
  that he wants to kill all teachers.
  Cops move out with 20 men to an anti-terror mission.
  Cops find me 5 minutes later on a street nearby.
  I do passive resistance.
  Cops put me in psychiatry.
  I am still in psychiatry today.
  The psychiatric expert says:
  I'm "crazy" because I am a loner,
  I am "dangerous" because I want to kill unworthy people,
  I am "suicidal" because I see my own genetics as unworthy.
