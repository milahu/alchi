Why? You afraid to fight me like a man?

00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:00,080
Kick her ass, Butters.
She called your stupid!

20
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:01,957
He <i>is</i> stupid!
Look at him!

21
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:05,168
At least he's not
a z-z-zitty-faced g-girl.

00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:06,253
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

23
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:08,380
Hey, hey. Whoa, guys.
Guys!

24
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,507
Come on. Hasn't this
gone on long enough?

25
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:13,385
Aren't we tired of being
so divided at school?

26
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,220
Get out of here, Cartman.
Nobody's buying it.

27
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:16,763
Yeah! Everyone knows you're the worst!

28
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,598
Hey! Leave him alone!

29
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:21,435
Eric tries to help, and you
guys call him names?

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,145
Sorry, baby.
I had to step in.

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,230
It's cool, baby.

32
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,608
Heidi?

33
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,403
Heidi has really been hurt
by all of this, you guys.

34
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:32,946
And I think for her sake,

35
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,407
it's time for us to all try
and come together.

36
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:37,242
As a school.

37
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,995
All right, sir. Don't be
nervous for your speech.

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,329
I know we're down a bit in the polls,

39
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,999
but there's still a great chance
we can win the swing states.

40
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:46,460
There's still a chance?
Are you serious?

41
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,128
Just one thing, sir.

42
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,338
Be a little careful what
you say about women.

43
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:53,675
Uh, seems like that might be
losing us some votes.

44
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,471
Oh, you don't say.

45
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,139
Ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:01,558
our country is divided
like never before,

47
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:04,311
and we all know that only
one man has the guts

48
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,271
to say what we're all thinking.

49
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:08,857
Please, welcome the man who,
with your help,

50
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:12,068
will soon be the next president
of the United States!

51
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,740
Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche!

52
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:19,284
Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche!
Douche! Douche! Douche!

53
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:20,494
Whoo!

54
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,997
So I'm standing in line at the airport,

55
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:27,250
waiting in security 'cause
of all the freakin' Muslims...

56
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,587
Ow!

57
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:32,088
And the TSA security people

58
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,132
all look like black thugs
from the inner city.

59
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:36,259
I'm like, "Oh, good.
You're gonna protect us?"

60
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:40,347
Well, maybe it's good
they're all gang members.

61
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:41,681
At least they can tell the difference

62
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:44,810
between Muslims and Mexicans
'cause God knows I can't.

63
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,105
So, you know,
I'm standing there in line.

64
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,816
And you know what I do?

65
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,318
I stick my finger in this
chick's asshole.

66
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:57,656
She turns to me and says,

67
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,033
"Hey, aren't you that guy
that's running for president?"

68
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,118
I say, "Yeah."

69
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:05,372
She says, "Why you got
your finger in my ass?"

70
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:07,165
I said, "I'm just
keeping it warm, honey,

71
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,542
'cause that chick
next to you is way hotter,

72
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,043
and I'm gonna stick it in her clam."

73
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,965
Yeah. Let's make American great again.

74
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,759
No dude wants his finger
in some ugly bitch's ass.

75
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,263
You got to be careful, though.

76
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:23,723
It's only about half an inch away,
that asshole and clam.

77
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,059
So you got to be careful, right, dudes?

78
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,561
Oh! Oh, where you going?

79
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:28,895
You leaving?

80
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,022
I'm sorry.
Did I offend you?

81
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:33,608
Where did I lose you, honey?

82
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,944
So you've been okay with the
"fuck everyone to death,"

83
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,279
all the Muslim and Mexican shit,

84
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:39,406
but fingers in the ass did it for you?

85
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:42,075
Cool. Just wanted to see
where your line was.

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,410
Oh, yeah. Look.

87
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:44,744
I guess some more broads are leaving.

88
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,996
Oh, geez.
You were so on board.

89
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,832
I can't believe I let that
little offensive remark slip!

90
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:49,791
Poor girls.

91
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,751
Did you get your feelings
hurt after cheering for

92
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,086
"Fuck all the immigrants"?

93
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:55,964
Geez. I'm sorry.
Geez.

94
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:02,345

Fellow trolls, we have
gathered together

118
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:08,828
because our anonymity
is being threatened.

119
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:12,499
Individually, we are some
of the most notorious trolls

120
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,084
in Colorado.

121
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,962
We must now find a way to unite.

122
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:21,633
Each one of us has the power
to make message boards go haywire,

123
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,594
the power to make
individuals buckle and fall.

124
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:28,640
Imagine if we use those skills
against a common enemy.

125
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,184
They have an entire
government at their disposal.

126
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:35,105

I believe that he is the key

129
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:44,489
All right, everyone.
Listen up.

130
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,659
This school is falling apart,
and it needs to stop.

131
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:49,536
Boys are harassing girls,

132
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,705
and girls are stereotyping
all boys as...

133
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,790
Not now, Mr. Stotch!
Put it away!

134
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:55,458
Okay.

135
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,793
Now, I've asked for some ideas,

136
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,712
and a couple of students
want to try and help.

137
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:00,130
Please welcome Heidi and Eric.

138
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:01,381
Hey, guys!

00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:02,966
What's up?

140
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,761
Guys, we have a lot of problems
facing our school.

141
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:08,388
I don't know if many of you know Heidi,

142
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:10,348
but she is really smart
and really funny.

143
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,599
Stop, Eric.

144
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:12,600
You are.

145
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:14,394

with a pretty cool idea.

146
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,395
Tell 'em, baby.

147
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,229
Thanks, babe.

148
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:17,897
I don't know if you guys
have heard, but right now,

149
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:20,483
Denmark is trying to make
trolling a thing of the past.

150
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:21,985
They're asking for help, and I thought

151
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,070
"Why not a school fundraiser?"

152
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:26,406
Yeah, but the way you said
it was way funnier, remember?

153
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:27,407
What? How did I say it?

154
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,868
Remember? You were like,
"What if we had a fundraiser in..."

155
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:31,077
What was it? Remember?

156
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:32,245
When was this?
Were we at Denny's?

157
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,872
Yeah. We were having
that dessert thing.

158
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:34,706
What was that?

159
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:36,666
Oh, and you kept spilling it
and everything.

160
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,834
Yeah, yeah.
Remember that?

161
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,503
- There was that guy that had...
- He had that weird haircut.

162
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,672
And you kept saying it looked
like he had a dick on his head.

163
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:43,673
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:46,760
That's when you said that totally
funny thing about...

165
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:55,602
Oh. Hey, guys.
W-What's up?

166
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,937
Oh, right! A school fundraiser.

167
00:06:58,063 --> 00:07:00,148
Tomorrow we'll be going
to each individual class

168
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:01,357
with more information.

169
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:02,442
And after that...

170
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,943
Then we should all come together.

171
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,612
As a school.

172
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,744
Sir, what were you thinking?

173
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,954
We said to be careful how you
talked about women!

174
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,289
Yeah. I don't know.

175
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,750
I guess I just kind of screwed
the pooch on that one.

176
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,502
We are way down in the polls!

177
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,462
I don't know how we recover from this!

178
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,631
Oh, really?
Geez. That's too bad.

179
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:27,425
A lot of us have staked
our lives on backing you!

180
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,511
You can't just go bonkers like this!

181
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:32,222
Hey. Sorry. I didn't realize
women were racists.

182
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:36,059
You have millions of supporters
who are looking to you to lead!

183
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:38,686
They're gonna want to know
what you're gonna do about this!

184
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:41,314
I mean, I don't know.
Nothing. Whatever.

185
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,066
You want to tell <i>them</i> that?

186
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,359
They're outside.

187
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,199
- What's going on?!
- What are you doing?!

188
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,618
Oh. Uh, hey, everybody.

189
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:56,913
Uh, yeah, looks like we're
tanking in the polls.

190
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:58,790
But you know what?

191
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:00,542
It's fixed.

192
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,711
I was never gonna win
in the first place.

193
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,589
I knew it from the beginning.

194
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:09,092
And on November 8th, when I lose,

195
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:12,971
I'll be able to say "I told you so!"

196
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:18,017
This sum'ma bitch pulled
a fast one on us!

197
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,936
It's like he's not even trying!

198
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,271
Oh, no. I'm... I'm trying.
I just...

199
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:22,772
Get him!

200
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:24,649
Shit!

201
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,490
Oh, geez!

202
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,075
- Get him!
- Tear his head off!

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,535
Don't let him get away!

204
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,370
Yee-ha!

205
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:52,051
- What do you want? Go away.
- Hey!

206
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:54,304
Just checking to see if you needed
any more refreshments

207
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:55,305
for the conference room.

208
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,015
We're fine.
We don't need anything.

209
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,308
Some more creamers?

210
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,143
- Just some more creamer.
- All right.

211
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:02,228
Well, just wanted to say
thanks for choosing...

212
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,564
Okay. We're clear again.

213
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,357
You were saying, Skankhunt?

214
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:09,068
All right. Look.
How do you troll somebody?

215
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,530
Say really fucked-up shit and
make them quit social media?

216
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:15,408
No, no, no.
It's not about one person.

217
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,411
It's about pushing people's
buttons so that they'll react

218
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:20,872
in a way that pushes
other people's buttons!

219
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:23,917
Look, you don't just troll
a woman with cancer

220
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,585
to get a reaction from her.

221
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,086
It's all about the group of people

222
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:28,922
that are gonna come to her defense!

223
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,882
They're gonna be so self-righteous

224
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,091
that <i>another</i> group of people

225
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:35,094
will eventually find <i>those</i>
people totally annoying!

226
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,597
You're just setting them
against each other!

227
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:39,307
It's like the fission reaction

228
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,851
that sets off the fusion explosion!

229
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,269
The Internet does it all,

230
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:46,814
and you just sit back with your
glass of wine and laugh!

231
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:51,903
Wow. That seems kind of... mean.

232
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,364
It's not mean if it's hilarious!

233
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:58,701
If we all worked with you,
Skank, could we do it?

234
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,746
Could we troll an entire country?

235
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,625
If we all work together?

236
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,168
Maybe.

237
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:08,836
Maybe.

238
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,550
Hey, guys!

239
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,636
Today we're gonna start
our school fundraiser.

240
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:20,056
It's an idea I came up with
called Danishes for Denmark.

241
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:21,975
It's awesome.
You're doing awesome!

242
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,351
We need everyone to do their part,

243
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:25,478
so later on in the cafeteria,
we are all gonna need...

244
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:29,023
Okay, children.
Let's take our seats.

245
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:31,776
Let's, uh, get back our lessons
on grammar, shall we?

246
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,403
Mr. Garrison?

247
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:36,239
Okay. Does anybody, uh,
remember where we left off?

248
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:37,407
No?
All right.

249
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,284
Who can tell me what an adjective is?

250
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,868
Thanks. You can go now.
I'm back.

251
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:42,829
Who can... Who can tell me
what an adjective is?

252
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,831
Uh, aren't you running for president?

253
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,457
Adjectives usually come before what?

254
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,418
They... They come before nouns.
That's right.

255
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,503
Mr. Garrison?

256
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,422
You can't just act
like nothing happened.

257
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,048
You're spiraling out of control,

258
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:55,633
and you have to answer to the people!

259
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:56,884
I don't know what you're talking about.

260
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,011
I am a teacher.

261
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,013
Okay. Adjectives describe nouns.

262
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:01,806
- And there are several types...
- Mr. Garrison.

263
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,266
What are some examples of adjectives

264
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,767
you can give me for this sentence?

265
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:07,103
You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison,

266
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,354
and you have to make good on it!

267
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,023
The yellow ball!
That's a good one.

268
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:12,608
Or we can say
"the slippery ball," can't we?

269
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,360
- Come on.
- What else about the ball?

270
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,571
No. Please. What else can we
say about the ball, children?

271
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:17,822
No! Please!
Leave me alone!

272
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,449
- The bouncy ball?
- No!

273
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:20,992
No! I'm not going back! Please!

274
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:24,287
They're gonna kill me! Children!
Help me, children! Help me!

275
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,375
Okay. Come on.
Office is upstairs.

276
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,793
Oh! Hi, honey.

277
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,795
Gerald, you're back
from your convention?

278
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,130
Yeah. It went really well.

279
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:35,882
This is, uh, my I.T. guy.

280
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,009
Gonna help me get my office
computer set back up.

281
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:40,303
Well, can I make you
guys something to eat?

282
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:42,472
Don't worry about us, hon.
Lots of work to do.

283
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,182
Love you so much!

284
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:46,851
Ike, no Internet tonight.

285
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:48,394
We need all the bandwidth we can get.

286
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,854
Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.

287
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,356
Hello.

288
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:55,902
I got to hand it to you, Gerald.

289
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,321
You have a really nice home.
Nice family.

290
00:11:58,446 --> 00:11:59,947
Well, now you see I have a lot to lose

291
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,240
if they find out who I am.

292
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,743
And who is that?

293
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:04,744
What?

294
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,746
I've studied your work.

295
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,915
You're so good at lashing out
at the system,

296
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,125
bringing people down
off their high horses.

297
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,377
Why do you do it?

298
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,545
I told you.
It's just funny to me.

299
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,922
I do it for the lolz.

300
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:17,673
I don't believe that.

301
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,718
I think there's more to Skankhunt.

302
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:24,055
When I was in school, kids teased me,

303
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,016
called me a midget even though I'm not.

304
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,935
My mother was a little person,

305
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,980
but she actually married a guy
who had gigantism syndrome.

306
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:35,983
She thought if she was a little person

307
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:41,406
and had a baby with a giant...
I would come out normal.

308
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,952
We can't let these Danish pricks

309
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:48,287
take away our online lives, Skank.

310
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:51,499

00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,730
Prepare for overreaction on my mark.

349
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:40,149
Three, two, mark.

350
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,082
Hey. Mr. Garrison.

351
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,375
Come on in, bud.

352
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,585
Have a seat.
You're not alone.

353
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:03,464
You're... You're not gonna
try and lynch me, too?

354
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,424
No lynchings here, little cowboy.

355
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,051
Take a seat.

356
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,345
You want to share with us
what you're going through?

357
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,307
It's... It's all my fault.
I just...

358
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:16,269
I just wanted to get rid of all
the immigrants, you know?

359
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,981
I just... I thought we could
fuck them all to death,

360
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,941
and everyone started listening to me.

361
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:22,942
Next thing I know,

362
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,611
I actually get the nomination
from the Republicans.

363
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:27,363
It's not your fault, little guy.

364
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:28,906
It <i>is</i> my fault!

365
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,284
I told people I could make
the country great again,

366
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,578
but I didn't have a plan!

367
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:34,745
Not your fault.

368
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,290
I got caught up in people
cheering for me,

369
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,083
being in the media every day.

370
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,086
I led this entire election
down the shitter!

371
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,088
You've got to stop blaming yourself.

372
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:46,007
Well, then whose fault is it?!

373
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:48,175
Here. Catch.

374
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,721
'Member Lando Calrissian?

375
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,056
'Member Tauntauns?
'Member?

376
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,474
'Member feeling safe?

377
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,310
What the fuck is this?

378
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,812
That is why millions of Americans

379
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:01,981
want you to be president.

380
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:03,441
But there's more.

381
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,454
It's started.

382
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,249
Did they pick it up on Yahoo?

383
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:22,501
Don't know, but Google has it
as the number-one story.

384
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:25,296
Oh, shit! Go to...
Go to Huffington.

385
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:27,715
<i>Millions of people took
to the Internet last night</i>

386
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,218
<i>after shocking claims were made
about the Danish company Lego</i>

387
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,346
<i>and their ties to ISIS.</i>

388
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:34,472
Oh, yes!

389
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,098
This is CNN front page right now.

390
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:38,017
<i>It now appears the country of Denmark</i>

391
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:40,353
<i>was the victim of a massive troll.</i>

392
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:43,522
<i>The country is still reeling
from the Lego hoax story.</i>

393
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:45,483
<i>Tom, by the time the hoax was revealed,</i>

394
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,360
<i>the damage had already been done.</i>

395
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:50,196
<i>Millions of people got
on the anti-Denmark bandwagon,</i>

396
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:52,865
<i>and when millions more
came in to support Denmark,</i>

397
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,535
<i>hundreds of millions more got
on the anti-Denmark bandwagon.</i>

398
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,746
We did it!
We did it!

399
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:00,331
Oh, Kyle. Uh, hey.

400
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,791
Didn't think you'd be leaving yet.

401
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,542
I have a fundraiser at school.

402
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:05,419
Well, did you see what's
all over the Internet?

403
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,672
Everyone's ripping on Legos.

404
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:08,881
What?

405
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,925
Yeah. The whole world
is blowing up with Danish jokes.

406
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,967
It's hilarious!

407
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,302
The <i>Guardian</i> has a bunch of stories up

408
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:14,720
about how the Denmark government

409
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,056
isn't responding to even
interview requests!

410
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,266
Wow! Fuck Denmark, huh, Kyle?

411
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:22,061
That's got to be what just about
everyone is thinking now.

412
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,188
Fuck Denmark.

413
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:31,404
Sir, public opinion of Denmark
is very, very shit.

414
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,906
All our social-media pages
are filled with millions

415
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,700
and millions of the horrible comments.

416
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:38,828
And our crowd-funding sites
are taken over, too.

417
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:42,081
Everyone is making fun of us
like we're goofballs.

418
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:44,166
How could this happen?

419
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,669
Because that's what trolls do!

420
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:48,796
I should have known
that once they got wind

421
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,757
of our little plan,
they would start trolling us!

422
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,051
So then Denmark isn't funding ISIS?

423
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,511
Of course not!

424
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:58,305
But how do we prove that
to the rest of the world?

425
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,642
We can't respond.
It will only make the trolls stronger.

426
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,769
Our only choice is to go offline.

427
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:05,980
You mean we have to quit Twitter?

428
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:08,357
Everything, you ignoramus!

429
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,109
The only way to stop the bleeding

430
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:13,571
is for Denmark to get off social media.

431
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,031
<i>Pokar Du troolldt!</i>

432
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:17,950
Hello.

433
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:21,078
Buy a Danish to help stop trolling?

434
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,497
How come nobody's stopping?

435
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,374
Maybe this was a terrible idea.

436
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,876
It was a great idea.

437
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,627
Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark!

438
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:31,338
Fuck Denmark!

439
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:32,923
That's it!

440
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,508
I am through with your stupid crap!

441
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,302
Every house I've been to
just rips on me

442
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,179
a-and says Denmark is stupid.

443
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:39,597
- What?
- It's true.

444
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,849
Denmark got trolled last night.
They left social media.

445
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:45,102
Then all of this was for nothing.

446
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,312
I told you, fellas!

447
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:48,814
This is what you get for working
with a bunch of stupid girls!

448
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:49,815
How is this our fault?

449
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,233
At least we actually did the work!

450
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,152
Oh, yeah? You guys
fucked up all the frosting.

451
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:54,820
You assholes overcooked them!

452
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,699
Oh, no! This <i>was</i> a terrible idea.

453
00:18:58,824 --> 00:18:59,825
Heidi!

454
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,870
I'm so stupid.

455
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,163
Don't say that.

456
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:05,164
Why did I even think

457
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,333
I could bring the boys
and girls together again?

458
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,752
Because you're smart and funny,
that's why.

459
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,629
It was a great idea, Heidi.

460
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:14,965
I think that somehow trolling
is playing a bigger part in this

461
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,343
than anyone even realizes.

462
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:24,517
Every great empire reaches a point

463
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:29,063
where going backward can seem
more appealing than forward.

464
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:31,482
When the world is changing so fast,

465
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:33,567
it makes us yearn for the old ways

466
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,529
when life seemed simpler.

467
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:40,366
But it doesn't mean those old
ideas are good for us now.

468
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:44,078
We have to face one hard reality
as a country.

469
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:48,874
The new "Star Wars" was not as good
as everyone thought it was.

470
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:54,004
It may seem fun to go back
and recycle the past we loved.

471
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,674
But we end up with no sustenance.

472
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,967
I thought you were gonna explain

473
00:19:58,092 --> 00:20:00,135
why people want a guy
like me to be president.

474
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:01,804
Well, that's important, too, I guess,

475
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,181
but it's just a symptom
of the same thing.

476
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:07,268
See, when a civilization
has become so big,

477
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,228
it starts to get lazy.

478
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:11,730
And that's when you get Memberberries.

479
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:13,399
They're nothing new.

480
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:16,277
They date back all the way
to the Roman empire.

481
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,737
Once too many Romans
ate the Memberberries,

482
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,573
there was no more growth.

483
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:21,907
They rested on their laurels,

484
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,743
just eating and 'membering
all the good stuff.

485
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,745
I think those are just grapes.

486
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,622
Thought so, too, till I zoomed in.

487
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:29,707
'Member?

488
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:32,751
You see, we all want to go back
to when we were kids.

489
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:36,922
Simple ideas like a big man
to protect us, keep us safe.

490
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,049
Instead of a fresh, new "Star Wars,"

491
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:43,304
we want the old, just recycled
and plopped in our tummies.

492
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:46,599
You almost make it sound
like J.J. Abrams is responsible

493
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,100
for this entire election.

494
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,311
Does this look familiar?

495
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,485
Oh, geez.

496
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:04,491
Sir! We've got a message from overseas.

497
00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:05,868
You really should see it.

498
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:07,202
A message how?

499
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:08,913
We're completely offline.

500
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:10,956
This was sent on a VHS.

501
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,709
Whoever sent it
is completely offline, too.

502
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,794
Put it on the screen.

503
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,007
<i>People of Denmark,</i>

504
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:22,593
<i>we know that you've been
the victim of trolling.</i>

505
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,094
<i>So have we.</i>

506
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,888
<i>Maybe we can help.</i>

507
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:27,640
<i>I'm not sure if you know
my girlfriend, Heidi,</i>

508
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:29,642
<i>but she's really smart
and really funny.</i>

509
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:30,935
<i>Stop it. No, I'm not.</i>

510
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,102
<i>You are, babe. Stop it.</i>

511
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,771
Who the hell are these people?

512
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:34,939
Just listen.

513
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:36,690
<i>Go on, babe. Just tell them.
Tell them.</i>

514
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,108
<i>I have an idea.</i>

515
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,818
<i>I might be able to figure out</i>

516
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,446
<i>the source of who
trolled you last night.</i>

517
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,032
Get everyone back inside.

518
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:47,660
If this girl really is that
smart and funny,

519
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,329
we might have another shot here.
