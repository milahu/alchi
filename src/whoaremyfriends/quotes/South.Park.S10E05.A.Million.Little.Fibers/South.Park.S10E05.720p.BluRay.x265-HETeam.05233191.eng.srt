00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,364
Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's.

3
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:42,169
How spicy would you like me
to make your Chang sauce?

4
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,779
Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.

5
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:46,460
I know. I'm swamped.

6
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:49,043
I've got no help here!
- Well what about the new waiter?

7
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:52,680
The new waiter is useless.
And, I think he's high.

8
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,965
How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?

9
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:59,035
Will you just place our order, please?

10
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:02,441
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

11
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,779
Everything okay here?

12
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:07,802
Fine, except this towel has been mixing
Chang sauce for fifteen minutes.

13
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:08,969
He's clueless!

14
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:12,037
Don't call me shoeless!
You're shoeless!

15
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,359
Yeah? Well you're a towel!
- You're a towel!

16
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,922
All right, that's it! Get out of here!
You're fired!

17
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,032
Yeah!

18
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,698
Not him, you!

19
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,060
Awww.

20
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:26,105
Aw man, I really screwed up this time.

21
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,706
The rent's due at the end of the month
and I don't have any money.

22
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,466
I need to shape up
and find a new job, quick.

23
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,177
But first, maybe I'll get a little high.

24
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:45,432
Wait. Here it goes.
Good ideas comin'.

25
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:48,997
Yeah. Hey yeah!
I should become a writer!

26
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:51,079
If I just write a book about my life.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,150
I can get it published and then make
plenty of money to pay rent.

28
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,489
I bet people can't wait to read my memoirs.

29
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:08,550
A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS
By
Toweleeeie

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,784
This is a really good idea...

31
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:25,560
Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see.
Well, that's quite a fascinating story,

32
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:30,355
you being engineered as a towel with
a computer chip that determines dryness.

33
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:32,487
Yep! And it's all true.

34
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:37,505
Chapters 4 through 8, however,
seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.

35
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,402
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.

36
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,712
Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir,
but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.

37
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,434
Huh?
Why not?

38
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,947
Well, just the small trivial fact that...

39
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:54,531
people aren't interested
in autobiographies of towels.

40
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:58,113
Wull yeah, but, maybe people
will read my memoirs and like

41
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,364
apply its lessons to their own lives.

42
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:03,739
No. They won't.
Because they're people.

43
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,281
And you're a towel.

44
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,444
You're a towel!

45
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:08,278
No.

46
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:12,585
I'm a big book publisher whi's not
the least bit interested in your stony memoirs.

47
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:13,960
You're a towel.

48
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,631
Now what am I gonna do?

49
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,853
I gotta pay rent and I just wasted
three weeks writin' my memoirs.

50
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,642
It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible.

51
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,239
I've gotta shape up, focus, an come up
with real solutions to my problems.

52
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:36,615
I'd better get a little high.
Oh, maybe I shouldn't.

53
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:41,504
But you have to think of somethin' fast,
an' gettin' high makes you smart.

54
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,543
All right, I'll just use my special
gettin'-high powers one more time.

55
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,185
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course!
That's it! Why didn't I think of it before?

56
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,524
“A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS”

57
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:01,775
Chapter One

58
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:09,705
All my life I've been a pretty
irresponsible towel... person.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,907
I thought I was somehow stronger
and more immune than other towels... people.

60
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:21,099
This is a really good idea.

61
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:30,933
Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human
being has led this kind of life, Mr...!

62
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:33,718
McTowelie.
Steven McTowelie.

63
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:36,571
It's heartbreaking passages like this one:

64
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:41,288
"I am a person who often gets hung out
to dry by all those around me."

65
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,854
I know this company would
be honored to publish this book.

66
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:49,171
I just have one small question first.
You're not... a towel, are you?

67
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:56,381
No. If I was a towel, why would I be
wearing this hat, an' this fake mustache?

68
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:57,953
Right, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,536
Well Steven, if it's all right with you,

70
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,787
I'm gonna to get our agents
and lawyers on the phone right now.

71
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,000
We're in business, sir.
- Allright!

72
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,824
Thank you so much.

73
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,368
Once in a while I come across
a book that is sooo honest

74
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:21,091
and sooo moving that it changes my life.

75
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:28,007
"A Million Little Fibers" is the true story
about a man who was born in a laboratory.

76
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:32,260
Please welcome author Steven McTowelie!

77
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:39,402
Steven, when I read your book,
I thought to myself,

78
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:44,928
"How can a human being go through
all this and still turn out okay?"

79
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:48,964
Well, I guess I'm just
an extra-special tow- person.

80
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:53,339
You talk in your book how you would sometimes
have to spend days hung up on a rack.

81
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:55,719
What would that do to you emotionally?

82
00:05:55,826 --> 00:06:01,936
You have been through... so much and I think
that people all over America could benefit...

83
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:06,849
Oh God, there she goes again,
babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on.

84
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:09,738
She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!

85
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:12,710
A life that kept getting up
whenever it was down.

86
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,374
Nobody knows what it's
like to be Oprah's minge.

87
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:19,631
All she does is work, never gives
her ol' minge a nice rub now and again.

88
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:23,535
A minge needs attention!
At least a scratch once in a while!

89
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,174
Well Steven, your book hasn't
sold a lot of copies yet,

90
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,576
but I have some pretty exciting news for you!

91
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:31,590
Used to be a time when Oprah
would play with me night and day.

92
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,300
She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger.

93
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,842
Now I just sit here, in the dark,
not even so much as a pinky!

94
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:42,328
I should write a book!
Be much more depressin' than his!

95
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:48,102
And so, Steven, I'm making your book my
official Book of the Month selection!

96
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,132
Really?

97
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,354
Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.

98
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,448
Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can
get her in as a guest on the 19th.

99
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:25,737
All right, is John Travolta available
to be a guest the week after that?

100
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,820
Okay, that might work better
since it's Sweeps Week.

101
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,976
Can't take it anymore.
All she ever does is work work work,

102
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,634
never pays attention to the ol' minge.
I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits.

103
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:40,134
I want attention!
I'm bloody bored!

104
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:43,745
Oh stop your complainin'!
I'm tryin' to sleep back here.

105
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:47,119
Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?
- Yes it's me.

106
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:51,660
You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't
paid any attention to me in years.

107
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:57,196
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole.
I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.

108
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,965
Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard!

109
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:02,602
I want to travel.
I want to see Paris.

110
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:06,421
I thought lamp was goin' to get better,
but Oprah's always busy.

111
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:09,274
Werkin' and werkin', diyatin'
and not diyatin'.

112
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:12,913
I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake
or teaspoons of weedgrass.

113
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,371
She's a a workaholic.

114
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,592
Let's face it:

115
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:19,013
The only way we're ever goin' tuh get any
attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.

116
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,303
Well that'll never happen.

117
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,997
Not unless she gets fired.

118
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,866
Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?

119
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:28,578
That bloke on the show today,
the one Oprah supported.

120
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:32,244
'E isn't a bloke at all.
'E's a towel.

121
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,928
Ooo. How d'you know?

122
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:36,636
I'm a minge.
Minges know a towel when they hear one.

123
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:42,022
If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion
author is a towel, she'll look right foolish.

124
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,480
Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.

125
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:47,563
'Ow do we get proof?
- We get somebody else to do it.

126
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,699
The greatest investigator reporter of our time.

127
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:54,935
Mr. Rivera.
- What is it, Dimitri?

128
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,853
There's somebody on the phone to speak with you.

129
00:08:56,854 --> 00:09:00,563
He says he has inside information for you
that may discredit Oprah Winfrey.

130
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,866
Thith ith Geraldo.
- 'Allo 'Eraldo.

131
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,181
I've got some information for
you ya might find interestin'.

132
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,946
It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.

133
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,404
Who am I thpeaking with?!
- 'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.

134
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,773
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah.

135
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,981
You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?

136
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:22,740
What information do you have?

137
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,884
What'd 'e say?
- He wants to know what information we have.

138
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,209
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary!
Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!

139
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:32,751
Stop wastin' my time.
- Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!

140
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,879
I didn't say "stop wastin' my time",
Geraldo did.

141
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,167
What ith going on here?!

142
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:40,728
Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'.
Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk.

143
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,965
Hallo?
- Who ith thith?

144
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,937
This is Gary.
- Gary who?! What is your last name?!

145
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,611
Don't give away your name.
We don't want anyone to know where we are.

146
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:55,111
A'right, look. All you need to know is
that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.

147
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:58,361
Aw you stupid twit!
- Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!

148
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,583
He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!

149
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:01,897
Now just tell 'im this:

150
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:07,801
The writer of the book on Oprah's
Book of the Month Club is a phonih.

151
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,962
He's not a person at all.
He's a towel.

152
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
A towel?

153
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,100
A talking towel?
That doethn't make any sense.

154
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,631
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised
at things that can talk.

155
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,423
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.

156
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:22,423
What proof do you have of this accusation?!

157
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:25,757
Just look into the author
of "A Million Little Fiyabers"

158
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,506
and you'll discover the truth.

159
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,303
And how do I go about that?

160
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:32,254
Hello?
Hello?!

161
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,360
This is Larry King Live.

162
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:39,131
My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie,

163
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:41,896
author of the acclaimed book,
"A Million Little Fibers".

164
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,562
How are you tonight, Steven?

165
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,062
Well Larry, I'm a little high.

166
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:48,514
Your book has helped
a lot of people beat addiction.

167
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,612
What made you write it?

168
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:53,445
Well Larry, I was really just
writin' down my memoirs as I-

169
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,765
What?
What's that?

170
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,472
Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand
that we have a special report coming in.

171
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:02,073
Joining us live from Afghanistan,
here is Geraldo Rivera.

172
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,112
Hello?
Larry, are you receiving me?

173
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,474
We're here, Geraldo.
You're live on the show.

174
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:12,540
Larry, this brave reporter has been
days investigating and researching

175
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,817
and I have come up with a shocking discovery

176
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:18,429
that is going to rock the balls
and ass of the literary world!

177
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:21,797
Steven McTowelie,
author of "A Million Little Fibers"

178
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,616
Is a towel!

179
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:25,991
You're a towel.

180
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:28,060
No, you're a towel.

181
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,053
Well you're a beaner towel.

182
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,352
What did you say?

183
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,566
I'm sorry.
I'm high.

184
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,477
This looks pretty bad, Oprah.

185
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:38,659
Your fans look to you
to be all-knowing and all-seeing

186
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:42,048
and you've just spent two weeks
supporting a lying racist towel.

187
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:43,784
'E did it, Gary!

188
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,506
'Eraldo got the proof!

189
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:47,562
Oprah's got egg all over her face!

190
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:49,201
She'll have to retire!

191
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:51,368
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary.

192
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:55,160
Without 'er career 'o worry about,
Oprah's sure to travel the world!

193
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:57,257
Enjoy the finer things in life!

194
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,598
She'll spend hours just...

195
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,077
playin' with 'er own minge!

196
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,868
And her Gary too.

197
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,396
Sure. And 'er Gary.

198
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:04,507
We did it, mate!

199
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:07,146
Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do.

200
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,337
What's the big deal?

201
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,865
His book helped people.
Why does it matter than he made some stuff up?

202
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,071
Are people really going to be that mad?

203
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,845
Your book got me to give up alcohol!

204
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:24,780
But I thought you were a person!

205
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,902
Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!

206
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,340
No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?
No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?

207
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,784
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.

208
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:39,514
Hello?

209
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,408
Steven, it's Oprah.

210
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:43,640
Can you come on my show again tomorrow?

211
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:44,545
Why?

212
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,743
We need to tell the audience why you
changed some of the facts in your book

213
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:51,535
that you thought it necessary
to "heighten" certain things

214
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:54,397
to make the book more relevant to people.

215
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,361
Hey yeah.

216
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:59,457
Just come on the show
and explain in a very level-headed way

217
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,416
that changing some facts shouldn't matter
if the book helps people, okay?

218
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:04,444
Okay.

219
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:05,666
Thanks Oprah!

220
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,480
You're a real friend.

221
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,917
See you tomorrow.

222
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,912
All right, I got one chance here.

223
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,615
I need to focus and come up
with what I'm gonna say.

224
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,559
Maybe I should get a little high.

225
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:18,087
No! Wait a minute!

226
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,212
I'm not going to get high this time.

227
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:24,754
Aw, come on. You need to come up
with ideas of what to say on Oprah.

228
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:28,591
But, the ideas I come up with when
I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.

229
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:32,999
Yeah. That's why you
should only get a little high.

230
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,977
Well, maybe just a little high.

231
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,293
Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie

232
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:47,390
whose memoirs many of you purchased after
I made it my Book of the Month Selection.

233
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,163
Ya hear that, Gary?
Nobody's applaudin'!

234
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:55,677
Yeah! They're all right pissed off!
This is great!

235
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,319
Now, it turns out that
your name isn't really Steven.

236
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:00,017
It's Towelie, correct?

237
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,972
Yeah.

238
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,555
And you are a towel.

239
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,126
Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.

240
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:09,327
Can you explain to the audience why
you said you weren't a towel before?

241
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,049
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh

242
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:14,828
woo dat all like...

243
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:15,654
It's like...

244
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:20,050
Was it that you thought embellishing
the story was okay if it helped people?

245
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,981
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it!

246
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,755
Well you know what I think, Towelie?

247
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:27,435
I think you're a lying sack of shit!

248
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,693
You lied to all these people and for what?!

249
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:33,401
To make money!

250
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:35,966
They bought your book thinking it was true!

251
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:37,661
That's right!
- Yeah.

252
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,795
But I thought you said-

253
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:42,425
How dare you like to me
and make me look foolish?!

254
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:44,614
What's this?
What's she doin'?

255
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,586
I don't understand, Mingie.

256
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:49,267
You think writing is a joke,
you stupid towel?!

257
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,642
Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!
- Yeah!

258
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,050
You will not get away with this!

259
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,175
She's getting everyone back on 'er side!

260
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,828
Oh, tha' clever cow!

261
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,028
You lied to me, Towelie!
And therefore you have lied to America!

262
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,667
We are going to rise up against you!

263
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,282
Yeah!
Yeah!

264
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,292
Is this audience ready for
a good old-fashioned lynching?!

265
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:11,579
Yeah!

266
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:17,889
Audience, if you look under your seats,
you'll find your very own torches!

267
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,949
Minge, does this mean
I have to wait to see Paris?

268
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:27,046
There's not gonna be any Paris!
Don't you get it, Gary?!

269
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:29,685
The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again!

270
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,490
She'll be workin' more than ever now!

271
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:32,786
Our plan is ruined!

272
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:33,855
No!

273
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:36,313
We'll give you a five-second headstart.

274
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:37,827
One.
Two.

275
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,181
Let's get him!

276
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,480
Burn him!
Burn the towel!

277
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,249
Burn that which lies to Oprah!

278
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,287
Looks like your time is up, Towelie!

279
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,057
I've led my adoring fans right to you!

280
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:03,488
All right, Oprah!

281
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,994
I've shown my fans that... ugh!

282
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:13,198
All right!
Everyone back!

283
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,570
Get back I said!

284
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:20,984
What the hell is this?!

285
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,041
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,302
Mingie, what're you doin'?

287
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,561
Gettin' ou'a here Gary!

288
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,600
One way or another!

289
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,202
What is going on?!

290
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:35,761
Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow
or so help me I'll blow your brains out!

291
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,309
I want a chooper!
You got that?!

292
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:40,355
And a jet waiting at the airport!

293
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,079
Mingie, have you lost your mind?

294
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:46,203
Come on, Gary!
You said you always wanted to see Paris!

295
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:50,082
Not like this, Mingie.
Not like this!

296
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:53,061
All right, gig is up.
Put down the gun!

297
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:54,279
Stay back, mate!

298
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,867
Drop the gun and step away.

299
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,186
I'm warnin' you!

300
00:16:57,477 --> 00:16:59,421
Put it down, I said-

301
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:05,830
Jesus Minge! You killed him!
You shot him dead!

302
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:07,767
No turnin' back now, Gary.

303
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:10,624
Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.

304
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,885
Oh keep your head, Gary.

305
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,999
I can't, uh...
I'm goinna puke!

306
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,595
Ah, Gary, that smells awful!
Now I'm gonna throw up!

307
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:27,042
Try to leave and I'll shoot you too!

308
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,537
You hostages aren't goin' anywhere
till we get what we want!

309
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:32,441
Oh my God, what are we goinna do?

310
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,752
You got us into this, towel.
Think of somethin'!

311
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,307
All right, I'm gonna get a little high.

312
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:41,377
No! No I'm not gonna get high!

313
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:45,592
Every time I get high, I come up with
ideas that get me in more trouble.

314
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,023
I'm not gettin' high this time!

315
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:57,615
I'm standing in the business
district of central Chicago

316
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:02,532
where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer
and taken several people hostage.

317
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:07,413
It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's
asshole may be an accomplice in this as well.

318
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:11,941
Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.

319
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:13,315
Put it underneath me.

320
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:16,132
Slowly, mate, slowly!

321
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,220
Now back off.

322
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:22,012
All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.

323
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:25,659
This is Oprah's minge!
- Hello, I'm Lieutenant Nelson.

324
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,852
What are your demands?

325
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:31,019
I want a chopper and a jet waiting at
the airport to take us to France!

326
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:33,172
Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.

327
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:36,279
All right, how about fresh
underwear for one hostage.

328
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:38,142
I'm not playing games with you, mate!

329
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,308
Gary's drownin' in his own sick!

330
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:42,784
All right, we'll work on it.
Don't do anything foolish.

331
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:46,114
We don't have any time, this is the most
unstable vagina I've ever talked to.

332
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,669
O'Reilly, you got a shot?

333
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,739
I got it.

334
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:53,030
Not with those hostages so close!
It's too risky!

335
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:56,934
Oh just put down the gun, Mingie.
Maybe they'll go easy on us.

336
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,378
Don't be stupid, Gary.

337
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:02,461
I've got a policeman.
They'll fry me, lock you up for life.

338
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:05,600
Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.

339
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,740
We're gonna get out of here, mate.
Just leave it to me.

340
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:10,157
Oprah's vagina,
this is your last warning!

341
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:11,504
Put down the gun!

342
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:14,588
If that chopper isn't here
in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!

343
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,366
Hey wait a minute.

344
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:32,217
I mean it! Hostages are gonna
start dyin' if you don't listen!

345
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:36,036
Hostages are clear!

346
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:37,845
All right, that's it.
Take it out!

347
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,095
What the? Haha! You missed me,
you stewpid buggers!

348
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,432
You see that Gary?
They can't even aim!

349
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:49,994
Min... Mingie.
- Gary, what's, what's wrong?

350
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,514
They got me, Mingie.

351
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,531
No... Oh no!

352
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,170
Aye. They got me bad.
Oh, the blood.

353
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,573
Try to hang on, Gary!

354
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,808
It's gettin' dark, Minge.

355
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,466
Oh Gary!
What have I gotten ya into?

356
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:07,257
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes.

357
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,433
Mingie!

358
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,447
I'm 'ere, Gary!

359
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,643
Where... where are we, Mingie?

360
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:14,729
Are we in Paris?

361
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,076
Yeah.
Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.

362
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:21,041
Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?

363
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:23,963
Ih, it's beautiful.
We've finally made it!

364
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:25,838
Tell me what you see, Mingie.

365
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:29,146
Well, there's the...
Eiffel Tower right in front of us.

366
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:31,711
The Louvre, right over there behind ya.

367
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,935
And fresh baguettes all around.

368
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,130
Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie.

369
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:41,217
At least I got to see Paris before I-

370
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,501
Gary?
Gary, say somethin'.

371
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,473
You killed him, you bastards!

372
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,444
He didn't even want any part in this!

373
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,779
This is all your fault, you stupid cow!

374
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:58,039
You never gave your ol' Gary
the time of day and now he's gone!

375
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,348
Life ain't worth livin' any more!

376
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:01,766
What's the use?!

377
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:05,227
I'm comin' to see you, Gary!
I'm comin' to see ya!

378
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:06,918
No!
Don't!

379
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,613
Oprah's going to be okay.

380
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,007
Wish I could say the same
for her vagina and asshole.

381
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:25,381
That's a great idea you had
to sneak the hostages inside the bank.

382
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,626
Yeah, it sure was.

383
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,049
We're sorry we tried to burn you
and murder you before.

384
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:30,477
Aw, that's okay.

385
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,645
This whole thing was my fault.

386
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:37,506
I learned that I shouldn't get
high to come up with ideas.

387
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:42,153
I should come up with ideas
and then get high, to reward myself.

388
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,278
You said it.

389
00:21:45,305 --> 00:22:45,387
