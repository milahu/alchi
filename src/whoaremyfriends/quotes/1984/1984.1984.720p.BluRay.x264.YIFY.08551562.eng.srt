- Morning Smith.
- Parsons.

111
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:19,632
- Heard the rumour?
- No. Good news is it?

112
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,530
I should say so yes.

116
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:40,743
By the way Smith, I seem to have run
out of razor blades for some reason.

you've got any razor blades.

124

I've tried all over the place. I've been
using the same one for six weeks.

126
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,639

00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:35,114

Yes.

139

It's a beautiful thing,
the destruction of words.

140
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:53,266
You won't have seen the
dictionary tenth edition yet Smith.

141
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:55,603
It's that thick.

142
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:58,567
The 11th edition will be that thick.

143
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,017
So the revolution will be complete
when the language is perfect?

144
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,743
The secret is to move from translation
to direct thought to automatic response.

145
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:15,614
- Language coming from here not here.
- Excuse me for intruding.

146
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,506
We shall be rid of Goldsteinism
when the language has been cleaned.

153
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,575
It's encouraging thought
that by 2050

154
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:57,363
not a single person
could have a conversation like this.

155
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:02,252
- Except the proles.
- Proletariat don't count. They're animals.

Missed it myself.

Do you know I don't think there is a
single piece of meat in this stew.

162
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:32,606
Looks like meat, tastes like
meat. It isn't meat at all.

163

Double plus good.

164
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:39,280
- Not like it Smith?
- Yes. It's too rich for me.

165
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,452

178

and no telescreens.

181

183

It was really the paint
that appealed to me,

184
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:32,338
the whiteness of it like a mask,
and the bright red lips.

185

There were no preliminaries.

natural erosion of the family unit,

325

As we all know the biological and
social stimulation of the family

leads to private reflection
outside Party needs

328

and to the establishment of unorthodox
loyalties which can only lead to thought crime.

329
00:41:00,814 --> 00:41:05,485
The introduction of Artsem, combined
with the neutralisation of the orgasm,

330
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:11,837

01:22:23,588 --> 01:22:25,502
A serious delusion.

684
01:22:27,126 --> 01:22:31,037
Photographs about which
you've had hallucinations,

685
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:34,730
which you believed
you held in your hand.

686
01:22:36,428 --> 01:22:38,468
They never existed.

687
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,956
Say what you're about to say Winston.

688
01:22:49,086 --> 01:22:51,838
They exist.

689
01:22:51,863 --> 01:22:54,856
In memory.

690
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,399
I remember.

691
01:22:58,486 --> 01:23:01,059
You remember.

692
01:23:01,097 --> 01:23:03,801
I do not remember.

693
01:23:03,933 --> 01:23:09,602
Only the disciplined mind
can see reality Winston.

694
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:13,842
It needs an act of self destruction,
an effort of the will.

695
01:23:15,444 --> 01:23:17,899
Do you remember writing in your diary.

696
01:23:17,924 --> 01:23:22,550
"Freedom is the freedom to say
two plus two equals four"?

697
01:23:23,617 --> 01:23:24,945
Yes.

698
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:28,179
How many fingers am I holding up?

699
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,947
Four.

700
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:34,773
And if the Party says there are not four
but five, then how many?

701
01:23:35,294 --> 01:23:37,333
Five?

702
01:23:39,017 --> 01:23:41,650
(WINSTON SCREAMS IN PAIN)

703
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:46,216
No.

704
01:23:46,345 --> 01:23:48,717
That's no use. You're lying.

705
01:23:50,888 --> 01:23:53,130
How many fingers please?

706
01:23:56,438 --> 01:23:59,272
Four, what else can I say?

707
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:06,269
Five, anything you like,
only please stop it.

708
01:24:06,294 --> 01:24:08,333
Stop the pain.

709
01:24:12,869 --> 01:24:15,407
How can I help it?

710
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:20,998
How can I help what
I see in front of my eyes?

711
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,996
Two and two makes four.

712
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,901
Sometimes, Winston,
sometimes they're five.

713
01:24:30,128 --> 01:24:35,204
Sometimes they're three.
Sometimes they are all of them at once.

714
01:24:44,511 --> 01:24:51,593
Neither the past nor the present nor the
future exists in its own right Winston.

715
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:58,301
Reality is in the human mind,
not in the individual mind.

716
01:24:58,436 --> 01:25:03,430
Which makes mistakes
and soon perishes,

717
01:25:03,813 --> 01:25:09,793
but in the mind of the Party,
which is collective and immortal.

718
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:14,915
Again.

719
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:15,987
No.

720
01:25:17,581 --> 01:25:21,018
(WINSTON'S GROANS IN PAIN AGAIN)

721
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:25,340
How many fingers Winston?

722
01:25:27,977 --> 01:25:30,847
Four... Four?

723
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:35,937
I suppose there are four
but I'm trying to see five.

724
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,481
- I wish I could.
- Which do you wish?

725
01:25:40,183 --> 01:25:43,717
To persuade me that you can see 
five or really to see them?

726
01:25:44,117 --> 01:25:46,109
Really to see them.

727
01:25:48,912 --> 01:25:50,952
Again.

728
01:25:58,963 --> 01:26:01,288
How many Winston?

729
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,344
I...

730
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,473
I don't know...

731
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:17,503
I don't know.

732
01:26:18,856 --> 01:26:20,895
Better.

733
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:43,237
No one escapes Winston.
There are no martyrs here.

734
01:26:43,455 --> 01:26:46,029
All the confessions made here are true.

735
01:26:47,483 --> 01:26:51,860
We do not destroy the heretic
because he resists us.

736
01:26:51,885 --> 01:26:55,799
As long as he resists us
we never destroy him.

737
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:59,630
We make him one of ourselves
before we kill him.

738
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:03,349
We make his brain perfect
before we blow it out.

739
01:27:04,188 --> 01:27:11,352
And then, when there is nothing left
but sorrow and love of Big Brother,

740
01:27:11,486 --> 01:27:14,605
we shall lift you clean out of history.

741
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:19,537
We shall turn you into gas and 
pour you into the stratosphere.

742
01:27:19,576 --> 01:27:21,901
Nothing will remain of you.

743
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:27,872
Not a name in a register,
not a memory in a living brain.

744
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,491
You will be annihilated in the past,

745
01:27:30,628 --> 01:27:33,083
as well as in the future.

746
01:27:34,298 --> 01:27:36,504
3,000

747
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:46,553
This time it won't hurt you.

748
01:27:48,418 --> 01:27:51,538
Before we bring this session to an end,

749
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:54,433
I want you to ask me your questions.

750
01:27:54,729 --> 01:27:57,184
I want you to clear your mind.

751
01:28:00,321 --> 01:28:02,112
Julia.

752
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:07,761
She betrayed you Winston.
Immediately. Unreservedly.

753
01:28:07,894 --> 01:28:12,306
All her rebellion, deceit,
folly, dirty mindedness

754
01:28:12,464 --> 01:28:14,706
has been turned out of her.

755
01:28:18,123 --> 01:28:20,744
Does Big Brother exist?

756
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:23,007
Of course.

757
01:28:24,786 --> 01:28:28,237
In the same way as me?

758
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:30,607
You do not exist.

759
01:28:34,056 --> 01:28:39,429
You have not asked me the question
that is uppermost in your mind Winston.

760
01:28:39,454 --> 01:28:41,779
You know what is in Room 101.

761
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:46,303
Everyone knows what's in Room 101.

762
01:28:50,401 --> 01:28:54,399
Now fix your eyes on mine.

763
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:14,838
What country is Oceania at war with?

764
01:29:15,387 --> 01:29:17,878
I...

765
01:29:18,015 --> 01:29:20,137
I don't remember.

766
01:29:20,454 --> 01:29:24,914
Oceania is at war with East Eastasia.
Do you remember that now?

767
01:29:25,355 --> 01:29:27,394
Yes.

768
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,430
How many fingers am I holding up?

769
01:29:32,925 --> 01:29:34,206
Five.

770
01:29:34,888 --> 01:29:38,838
You see at least that it is possible.

771
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:48,292
You've understood the reality of the
past and the present Winston.

772
01:29:49,112 --> 01:29:51,151
Now what of the future?

773
01:29:52,628 --> 01:29:54,035
Question.

774
01:29:55,370 --> 01:30:00,290
How does one man
assert power over another?

775
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:04,294
- By making him suffer.
- Exactly.

776
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:07,301
Obedience is not enough.

777
01:30:07,434 --> 01:30:11,762
Power is inflicting pain and humiliation
otherwise you cannot be sure.

778
01:30:12,205 --> 01:30:16,617
Power is tearing human minds apart

779
01:30:16,652 --> 01:30:21,112
and putting them together again
in new shapes of your own choosing.

780
01:30:21,245 --> 01:30:24,448
Power is not a means, it is an end.

781
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:30,031
In our world there will only be triumph
and self-abasement.

782
01:30:30,056 --> 01:30:33,056
Everything else we shall destroy.

783
01:30:33,423 --> 01:30:35,353
The past is forbidden.

784
01:30:35,378 --> 01:30:36,829
Why.

785
01:30:37,273 --> 01:30:40,891
Because when we can cut 
man from his own past,

786
01:30:41,143 --> 01:30:45,492
then we can cut him from his family.
His children, other men.

787
01:30:47,864 --> 01:30:52,407
There is no loyalty
except loyalty to the Party.

788
01:30:52,721 --> 01:30:56,136
There is no love except 
love of Big Brother.

789
01:30:56,171 --> 01:31:00,832
All competing pleasures, we will destroy.

790
01:31:02,672 --> 01:31:08,959
If you want a vision of the future imagine
a boot stamping on a human face forever.

791
01:31:13,598 --> 01:31:15,638
Winston...

792
01:31:16,892 --> 01:31:21,269
You are thinking that 
my face is old and tired.

793
01:31:21,294 --> 01:31:26,597
That while I talk of power I am unable
to prevent the decay of my own body.

794
01:31:28,688 --> 01:31:32,271
But the individual is only a cell Winston.

795
01:31:32,306 --> 01:31:36,599
The weariness of the cell is 
the vigour of the organism.

796
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:38,405
You'll fail.

797
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,249
Why?

798
01:31:40,285 --> 01:31:43,369
It's impossible.

799
01:31:43,745 --> 01:31:47,908
Hatred and fear have no life.

800
01:31:48,215 --> 01:31:51,418
Why is hate less vital than love?

801
01:31:51,755 --> 01:31:55,206
I don't know but somehow you'll fail.

802
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:59,341
Something will defeat you.

803
01:31:59,366 --> 01:32:05,319
- Life will defeat you.
- We control life at all levels.

804
01:32:06,174 --> 01:32:12,344
We create human nature.
Men are infinitely malleable.

805
01:32:12,673 --> 01:32:17,733
Or perhaps you will return to your old idea
that the proletarians will arise.

806
01:32:17,758 --> 01:32:23,000
Put it out of your mind.
They are helpless animals.

807
01:32:23,243 --> 01:32:26,991
Humanity is the party.

808
01:32:27,273 --> 01:32:31,899
I don't care, in the end they'll beat you.

809
01:32:32,027 --> 01:32:36,238
Sooner or later they'll
tear you to pieces.

810
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,877
On what evidence?

811
01:32:39,902 --> 01:32:41,729
Goldstein's book.

812
01:32:43,316 --> 01:32:47,693
I wrote it, or at least
I collaborated in writing it.

813
01:32:48,225 --> 01:32:52,518
No book is individually
produced as you know.

814
01:32:52,707 --> 01:32:55,280
I just believe it.

815
01:32:56,334 --> 01:32:59,251
I know you'll fail.

816
01:32:59,557 --> 01:33:06,472
There's something in this world, some 
spirit that you will never overcome.

817
01:33:07,012 --> 01:33:09,716
What is it, this principle?

818
01:33:10,512 --> 01:33:12,551
I don't know.

819
01:33:13,411 --> 01:33:16,198
The spirit of man.

820
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:18,284
Do you consider yourself a man?

821
01:33:19,413 --> 01:33:20,658
Yes.

822
01:33:23,158 --> 01:33:26,242
If you're a man, you're the last man.

823
01:33:26,811 --> 01:33:31,473
Your kind is extinct.
We are the inheritors.

824
01:33:33,537 --> 01:33:36,704
Do you understand that you're alone?

825
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:39,868
You're outside history.

826
01:33:41,227 --> 01:33:43,266
You unexist.

827
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:48,070
Get up.

828
01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:08,664
Come here.

829
01:34:25,955 --> 01:34:30,283
Look at you, you're rotting away.

830
01:34:43,227 --> 01:34:46,263
That is the last man.

831
01:34:46,404 --> 01:34:49,358
If you're human, that is humanity.

832
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,350
It won't last forever.

833
01:34:54,619 --> 01:34:58,201
You can escape from it
whenever you choose.

834
01:34:58,301 --> 01:35:00,210
Everything depends on you.

835
01:35:00,344 --> 01:35:02,383
You did it.

836
01:35:02,972 --> 01:35:05,545
You reduced me to this.

837
01:35:05,823 --> 01:35:09,951
No Winston you reduced yourself to it.

838
01:35:11,838 --> 01:35:14,293
When will you shoot me?

839
01:35:16,285 --> 01:35:18,408
It might take a long time.

840
01:35:19,586 --> 01:35:22,041
But don't give up hope.

841
01:35:22,171 --> 01:35:24,840
Everyone is cured sooner or later,

842
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:29,670
and in the end

843
01:35:29,886 --> 01:35:32,045
we shall shoot you.

844
01:35:32,533 --> 01:35:35,617
The law of gravity is nonsense.

845
01:35:35,642 --> 01:35:37,883
No such law exists.

846
01:35:38,136 --> 01:35:43,238
If I think I float and you think
I float then it happens.

847
01:35:45,132 --> 01:35:46,588
I love you.

848
01:35:46,613 --> 01:35:48,292
You have the strength Winston.

849
01:35:48,317 --> 01:35:50,418
You have the whole party.

850
01:35:50,613 --> 01:35:52,356
You are the Party.

851
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:54,372
You're one of us.

852
01:35:54,396 --> 01:35:55,886
One of the chosen.

853
01:35:56,308 --> 01:35:57,959
I love you.

854
01:35:58,589 --> 01:36:00,268
I love you too.

855
01:36:02,605 --> 01:36:04,385
(GUNSHOT)

856
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:07,541
Julia.

857
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,169
Julia my love.

858
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:14,881
Julia.

859
01:36:16,595 --> 01:36:18,468
Julia!

860
01:36:20,032 --> 01:36:22,048
Julia!

861
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,235
TELESCREEN: Get up

862
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:32,139
TELESCREEN: Stand up straighter.

863
01:36:33,151 --> 01:36:35,190
TELESCREEN: Look me in the face.

864
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:43,165
Tell me Winston and remember no lies.

865
01:36:45,227 --> 01:36:49,390
What are your true feelings
towards Big Brother?

866
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:51,231
I hate him.

867
01:36:51,256 --> 01:36:53,568
You must love him.

868
01:36:53,755 --> 01:36:57,337
It's not enough to obey him.
You must love him.

869
01:37:00,463 --> 01:37:02,705
Room 101.

870
01:37:28,992 --> 01:37:33,155
You asked me once Winston
what was in Room 101?

871
01:37:33,396 --> 01:37:36,349
I told you that you knew already.

872
01:37:36,374 --> 01:37:38,413
Everyone knows.

873
01:37:40,559 --> 01:37:43,728
The thing that is in Room 101,

874
01:37:44,112 --> 01:37:46,781
is the worst thing in the world.

875
01:37:57,462 --> 01:38:01,162
It goes beyond fear of pain or death.

876
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:06,631
It is unendurable and it varies
from individual to individual.

877
01:38:06,859 --> 01:38:11,402
It may be burial alive or castration.

878
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:13,569
Or many other things.

879
01:38:18,403 --> 01:38:19,942
In your case,

880
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:21,769
it's rats

881
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:23,783
No!

882

(RATS SQUEALING)

883
01:38:28,295 --> 01:38:33,003
- Please, what do you want me to do?
- You will do what is required of you.

884
01:38:33,672 --> 01:38:35,664
What, what?

885
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,047
What.

886
01:38:37,595 --> 01:38:40,699
How can I do it if I
don't know what it is?

887
01:38:42,266 --> 01:38:45,730
In the proletarian areas
they will attack a baby

888
01:38:46,173 --> 01:38:49,956
and within five minutes
strip it to the bone.

889
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:53,760
They also attack the sick and dying.

890
01:38:54,193 --> 01:38:59,031
They show astonishing intelligence in
knowing when a human being is helpless.

891

(RATS SQUEAL AGAIN)

892

The mask fits over your
head leaving no exit.

894
01:39:18,381 --> 01:39:23,437
I press the first lever and the rats
move into the front compartment.

895
01:39:23,969 --> 01:39:28,346
I press the second and the
door of the cage will slide up.

896
01:39:28,726 --> 01:39:32,558
These starving brutes
will shoot at you like bullets.

897
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:36,114
Have you ever seen a rat 
leap through the air?

(RATS SQUEAL)

899
01:39:39,483 --> 01:39:43,646
They will leap onto your face
and bore straight into it.

900
01:39:44,005 --> 01:39:47,290
Sometimes they attack the eyes first.

901
01:39:48,908 --> 01:39:53,486
Sometimes they burrow through
the cheeks and devour the tongue.

What do you want?

905

Help me.

No! No!

01:40:16,808 --> 01:40:18,847
I love you.

Do it to her, do it to Julia.

910
01:40:24,356 --> 01:40:28,650
I don't care what you do to her. Tear
her face off! do it to Julia not to me.

Do it to Julia!

Not me!

Thank you for coming.

<i>15.30</i>

923

I'm very worried about the African front.

924
01:42:14,743 --> 01:42:19,537
The news is disquieting in the extreme.
I've been worrying about it all day.

925
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:21,950
It's not just a question of losing Africa.

926
01:42:22,193 --> 01:42:27,399
For the first time the territory of Oceania
itself is threatened by invasion.

927
01:42:27,712 --> 01:42:30,000
It's inconceivable.

928
01:42:37,057 --> 01:42:41,802
It must have been possible
to outflank them in some way.

929
01:42:48,184 --> 01:42:50,223
I have an instinct.

930
01:42:51,435 --> 01:42:53,262
There's bad news on the way.

931
01:42:59,061 --> 01:43:01,386
I told them all about you.

932
01:43:04,021 --> 01:43:08,018
I'm only thankful they got 
me before it was too late.

933
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:11,396
Yes I told them about you too.

934
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,655
Thought crime.

Sex crime, all your treachery.

Yes.
