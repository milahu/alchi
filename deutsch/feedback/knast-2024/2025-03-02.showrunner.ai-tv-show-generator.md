New Showrunner AI: The Sum Of All Hollywood's Fears

As Hollywood actors and writers strike, a company called The Simulation (formerly Fable Studio) has introduced Showrunner, a new AI application that can create 22-minute generative AI TV fan and parody episodes of popular shows. 

To demonstrate the power of Showrunner, The Simulation released a 22- minute TV episode of South Park today, “Westland Chronicles,” which centers on the ongoing WGA (Writers Guild of America) strike and a Hollywood studio, Bizney, that uses AI with disastrous results.

The episode, and Showrunner’s technology, confirm the threat of AI is a real, not existential, problem. Indeed, Showrunner’s creators say it's too dangerous to release to the public.

Maas started working on the Showrunner program last year when powerful open-source AI models like Open AI and Stable Diffusion were released.

Anyone can download an open-source AI program from Git and run it on a PC with appropriate power, for free. The secret sauce is in the training of the models, and the skills required to prompt them.
