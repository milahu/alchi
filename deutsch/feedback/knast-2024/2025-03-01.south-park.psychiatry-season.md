south park psychiatry season.

my episodes of south park. with the original style and all. just "selfmade". stolen. fuck copyright. yay bittorrent. yay darknet. yay gitea. fuck censorship.

my episodes tell the story of my life. how i discover my pallas hypothesis, how cops throw me in jail for distributing my book, ... currently im still in jail, this would be a massive help to get public attention for my case.

i see south park in general as a big intelligence test. smart people love south park. but one big grey area in the existing episodes is the topic psychiatry and how it is abused for political control not only in china or russia.

my case is in germany. see also https://github.com/milahu450/alchi/tree/master/deutsch/feedback/knast-2024/

im determined to do this, so your "no" would just slow down my work.
