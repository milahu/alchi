# why was my other account removed

why was @milahu450 removed?

this was my temporary account
i needed from 2024-12-09
because since then [im in jail](https://github.com/milahu/alchi/blob/master/deutsch/feedback/knast-2024/2024-12-09.prison-for-book-distributor.md)
so i temporarily lost access to @milahu

let me guess this was done
by "the nix community" [again](https://github.com/milahu/hate-maintainers-censored)?
i made the "mistake"
to post a comment
in one of my PRs at nixos/nix
re circular dependemcy errors
https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/6585

i noticed because some issues were missing in
https://github.com/milahu/deutschetorrents/issues

sorry for bothering you
thanks for your service
