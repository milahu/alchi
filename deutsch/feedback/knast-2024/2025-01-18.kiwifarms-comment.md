since 2024-12-09 i have been in psychiatric prison
because i distributed my pallas book in public
and because i put up passive resistance against the cops.

see also https://github.com/milahu/alchi/issues/58

you idiots will be happy
because it's "not my problem",
because it's not your ass that's sitting in jail innocently.

the stupid thing is:
tranquilizers like olanzapine
don't change my world view,
which i have built up
over 20 years of life experience
(from my puberty onwards).

so i'm here in prison for life
until i actively cooperate with the "therapies"
and until the "doctors" say that i'm "healthy" again.
